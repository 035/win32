# Microsoft TV Technologies System Requirements

The minimum system requirements for running digital TV applications are greater than the minimum requirements for Windows XP. A digital TV application requires the following:

-   A digital TV tuner that is compatible with Broadcast Driver Architecture (BDA).
-   600-MHz CPU with 128 MB RAM
-   DirectX Video Acceleration-compatible video card with 32 MB VRAM
-   DirectX VA-compatible MPEG2 decoder

Further requirements for the video card are described in [VMR System Requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd390959)
