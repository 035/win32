# Stream Buffer Engine

The Stream Buffer Engine (SBE) enables an application to seek, pause, and record a live video stream without interrupting the stream. Transitions between live and recorded content are seamless. The SBE supports MPEG-2 video and digital video (DV) sources, at capture rates up to 20 megabits per second (Mbps). The SBE also enables playback of recorded TV files in either .wtv or .ms-dvr format.
