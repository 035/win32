# Microsoft TV Technologies

## Purpose

Microsoft TV Technologies enables the rapid development of digital and analog TV applications on the Windows platform. It consists of several components provided by Microsoft, along with specifications for additional components to be provided by third parties.

Microsoft TV Technologies provides built-in software support for all major analog and digital broadcast standards, including ATSC, DVB, NTSC, PAL, SECAM and more. Full support is also provided for IP data services and closed captioning.

Applications based on Microsoft TV Technologies are de-coupled from the details of tuning and are therefore network-independent. This means that the same application can be used with an analog terrestrial or cable broadcast, a ATSC terrestrial broadcast, a DVB-S network, or any other network type for which support may be added in the future by Microsoft or a third party.

> [!Note]  
> This documentation assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of the analog, ATSC, and DVB broadcast standards, as well as MPEG-2 transport streams in general. Information on these topics is widely available on the World Wide Web.
