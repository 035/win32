# Unified Tuning Model

The Unified Tuning Model is an API that defines tuning on any type of network, using any kind of compatible device. Microsoft TV Technologies includes software components that implement the Unified Tuning Model for several network types, including ATSC and Digital Cable. Third parties can implement the Unified Tuning Model for other network types.
