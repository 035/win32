# Components of Indexing Service

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service consists of several logical components that perform its managing, indexing, and querying tasks. Each of these logical components consists of one or more files, such as executable files (exe), dynamic-link libraries (DLL), or other file types.

An end user of Indexing Service usually accesses these components through the MMC or the **Start, Search for Files, or Folder** dialog box. To see how an application or script accesses these components, see [Combinations of Tasks, Languages, and APIs](combinations-of-tasks--languages--and-apis.md).

The following topics describe the logical components and list the files that constitute each component in Indexing Service 3.0.

-   [Administration Component](administration-component.md)
-   [Change-Notification Component](change-notification-component.md)
-   [Filtering Component](filtering-component.md)
-   [IFilter Component](ifilter-component.md)
-   [Indexing Component](indexing-component.md)
-   [Language Resources](language-resources.md)
-   [Querying Component](querying-component.md)
-   [Retrieval Component](retrieval-component.md)
-   [Scanning Component](scanning-component.md)
