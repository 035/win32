# Property Indexing

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This section describes what happens to document properties as they are indexed after being filtered from a document. The topics include:

-   [Indexing Text-Type and Value-Type Properties](indexing-text-type-and-value-type-properties.md)
-   [Caching Value-Type Properties](caching-value-type-properties.md)
-   [Representing the Catalog Conceptually](representing-the-catalog-conceptually.md)
