# Command-Tree Nodes and Operators

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This section describes the command-tree nodes used by the OLE DB Provider for Indexing Service. The [**ICommandTree**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/cmdtree/nn-cmdtree-icommandtree) interface uses these nodes and their corresponding operators. The nodes consist of only data manipulation language (DML) nodes. The section includes the following topics.

-   [Catalog of DML Nodes](catalog-of-dml-nodes.md)
-   [Data Manipulation Operators](data-manipulation-operators.md)
