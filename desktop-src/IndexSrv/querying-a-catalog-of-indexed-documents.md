# Querying a Catalog of Indexed Documents

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Querying-related processing of Indexing Service receives a query in one of the supported query languages and then returns references from the selected catalog to documents that match the specified query. The catalog can reside on the local host computer performing the querying, or the catalog can reside on a remote computer. The following topics describe the querying in greater detail.
