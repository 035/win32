# SQL Queries and SQL Extensions

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service accepts queries composed in structured query language (SQL). Indexing Service uses a SQL syntax which contains extensions to the subset of SQL-92 and SQL3 queries for relational database systems.

Visual Basic and Visual J++ applications and VBScript and JScript scripts can submit SQL queries using the methods of Microsoft [ActiveX Data Objects](programming-apis.md#-idxs-activex-data-objects-api) (ADOs). Visual C++ applications can submit SQL queries using the interfaces of [OLE DB Provider](programming-apis.md#-idxs-ole-db-provider-api) for Indexing Service.

This section describes the syntax of SQL queries for Indexing Service. The statements and clauses, in their usual order of use, include the following:

-   [SET statement](set-statement.md)
-   [CREATE VIEW statement](create-view-statement.md)
-   [SELECT statement](select-statement.md)
-   [FROM clause](from-clause.md)
-   [WHERE clause](where-clause.md)
-   [ORDER BY clause](order-by-clause.md)
-   [Batched statements](batched-statements.md)

For details about the semantics and use of SQL queries, see [SQL Query Language](sql-query-language.md).
