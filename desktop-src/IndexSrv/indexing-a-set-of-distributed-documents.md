# Indexing a Set of Distributed Documents

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The indexing-related processing of Indexing Service takes one or more sets of distributed documents and produces indexed catalogs for those sets. The document sets can reside on the local host computer performing the indexing, or the documents can reside on a remote computer. The following topics describe the indexing in greater detail.

-   [Indexing and Managing](indexing-and-managing.md)
-   [Updating a Catalog](updating-a-catalog.md)
-   [Filtering, Word Breaking, and Removing Noise Words](filtering--word-breaking--and-removing-noise-words.md)
-   [Merging Indexes](merging-indexes.md)
