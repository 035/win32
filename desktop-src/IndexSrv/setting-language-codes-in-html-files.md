# Setting Language Codes in HTML Files

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

If you had a website containing documents in different languages, you could [set the MS.Locale](setting-ms-locale.md) property in each document for queries on documents in a certain language, and set the Content-Type variable so that the proper [character set](setting-charset.md) is displayed in the results. You should set both of these variables if your HTML pages are written in different languages.
