# Variables within Query Strings

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Within a query string that is set by an end user or set programmatically, Indexing Service recognizes certain syntaxes that it converts back and forth from IXSSO Query object properties in the server-side scripting to conventional URL tags for the HTML client. See the following sections for more information.

-   [QUERY\_STRING Variables](query-string-variables.md)
