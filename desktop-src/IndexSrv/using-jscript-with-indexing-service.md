# Using JScript with Indexing Service

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

JScript is a standard scripting language used primarily for the Web that you can use with Windows Script Host to manage and query Indexing Service. This section discusses several aspects of using JScript with Indexing Service and includes a JScript code example. The topics include the following.
