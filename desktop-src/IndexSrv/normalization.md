# Normalization

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service stores documents of all languages in a single index. Although words and linguistic rules differ dramatically, there are some considerations, such as numbers, dates, and times, that are handled consistently across all word breakers.

For more information about normalization considerations that may affect your word breaker implementation, see [Surface Form Normalization](surface-form-normalization.md).
