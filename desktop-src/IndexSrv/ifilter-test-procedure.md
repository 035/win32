# IFilter Test Procedure

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

After the filter has been initialized, the ifilttst.exe program conducts a series of tests on the filter. These tests are described in the following sections.

-   [Validation Test](validation-test.md)
-   [Consistency Test](consistency-test.md)
-   [Invalid Input Test](invalid-input-test.md)
-   [Testing Different IFilter Configurations](testing-different-ifilter-configurations.md)

In addition to following the IFilter test procedures, ensure that your IFilter implementation employs secure code practices. For more information about writing secure code for Indexing Service, see [Secure Code Practices](secure-code-practices.md).
