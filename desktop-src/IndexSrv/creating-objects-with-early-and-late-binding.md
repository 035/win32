# Creating Objects with Early and Late Binding

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The way you programmatically create objects of the Indexing Service APIs determines whether the objects are bound early or late. To use early binding, you declare an object using its prog ID, or you first create a reference for the object to a type library. To use late binding, you declare an object as the generic **Object** class. This section shows how to create, either with early or late binding, the objects for the Indexing Service APIs. The topics include the following.

-   [Creating Query Helper Objects](creating-query-helper-objects.md)
-   [Creating ADO Objects](creating-ado-objects.md)
