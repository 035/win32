# Query Syntax of Indexing Service Query Language

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This section describes the main features of Dialect 2 of the Indexing Service query language — similar to Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) — and its long- and short-form expressions and its default values and modes. It also describes the two broad types of queries — content and property-value queries — and how to specify property names. For a reference to the complete Dialect 2 syntax, see [Syntax of Query Language Dialect 2](syntax-of-query-language-dialect-2.md). This section includes the following topics.

-   [SGML-Style Syntax](sgml-style-syntax.md)
-   [Long Form, Short Form, and Defaults](long-form--short-form--and-defaults.md)
-   [Content and Property-Value Queries](content-and-property-value-queries.md)
-   [Property-Name Syntax](property-name-syntax.md)
