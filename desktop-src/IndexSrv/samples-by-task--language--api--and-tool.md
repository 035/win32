# Samples by Task, Language, API, and Tool

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The Platform SDK includes several samples of programming for Indexing Service. This section summarizes those samples organized by task, language, API, and tool. The following topics list the included samples by task category.

-   [Managing Samples](managing-samples.md)
-   [Querying Samples](querying-samples.md)
-   [Indexing Samples](indexing-samples.md)
-   [Language Resources Sample](language-resources-sample.md)

For an alphabetical summary of the samples with brief descriptions, see [Installing the Samples](installing-the-samples.md).
