# Nonbreaking Spaces

> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

When you create a word breaker, it is recommended that you ensure that the word breaker treats nonbreaking spaces as word separators. It is also recommended that the word breaker generate alternative forms of the word, with and without nonbreaking spaces. Some characters, such as underscores, are special characters that are treated as nonbreaking characters because of the sources of text. For example, source code or file names may include underscores as nonbreaking characters.
