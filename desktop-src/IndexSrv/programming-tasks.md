# Programming Tasks

\[Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.\]

When you program for Indexing Service, the tasks you want to accomplish fall into three general categories: managing, querying, and indexing.

The following table lists these types of tasks and gives a brief description of each.



| Task Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Managing             | Includes retrieving and setting the Indexing Service catalogs and their scopes, retrieving and setting entries in the registry, and determining and controlling the state of Indexing Service activity.                                                                                                               |
| Querying             | Includes constructing, submitting, and presenting a query in one of the Indexing Service query languages to a specified Indexing Service catalog and retrieving the results.                                                                                                                                          |
| Indexing (Filtering) | Includes developing [IFilter](/windows/win32/Filter/nn-filter-ifilter?branch=master) implementations for custom file types and selecting features of standard filter implementations. Also includes [IWordBreaker](iwordbreaker.md) implementations that allow Indexing Service to incorporate documents in their native languages and locales into the index. |
