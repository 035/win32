# Filtering Directories

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

By default, directories are not filtered and do not appear in query results. To filter directories, set the registry entry [FilterDirectories](filterdirectories.md) to one. Filtering directories treats the system properties of the directories.
