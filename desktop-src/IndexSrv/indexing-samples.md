# Indexing Samples

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The following samples are examples of indexing (the filtering component) with Indexing Service. The table gives the name of the sample and the tool, language, and API that the sample illustrates. Selecting the name of a sample takes you to a detailed reference for that sample.
