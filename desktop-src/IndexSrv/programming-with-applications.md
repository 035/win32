# Programming with Applications

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Prior to Indexing Service 3.0, you typically had to perform most Indexing Service tasks using scripts with Web-server tools such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Internet Information Services (IIS). With Indexing Service 3.0 you can perform file system-oriented tasks with several programming languages as well as several scripting languages. This section includes the following topics that describe the use of the Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, and Microsoft Visual J++ development systems with the Microsoft Visual Studio development system to construct applications:

-   [Programming with Visual Basic](programming-with-visual-basic.md)
-   [Programming with Visual C++](programming-with-visual-c--.md)
-   [Programming with Visual J++](programming-with-visual-j--.md)

For information about using the Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) and Microsoft JScript development software with Microsoft Windows Script Host, see [Programming with Scripts](programming-with-scripts.md). For information about using scripts with a Web-server tool, see [Using Indexing Service with Web Servers](using-indexing-service-with-web-servers.md). For information about Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), see [ActiveX Data Objects](dasdkadooverview).
