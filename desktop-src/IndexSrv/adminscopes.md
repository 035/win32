> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The AdminScopes form performs one of several actions on a selected scope of a catalog. This form appears when the name of a path in the scope tree view on the [ISAdminForm](isadminform.md) form is right-clicked. The AdminScopes form contains the following controls.

-   An option button to remove the scope.
-   An option button to force a full rescan of the scope.
-   An option button to perform an incremental rescan of the scope.
-   A command button to perform the selected action.
-   A command button to cancel the action.

The following topics discuss selected code segments for the AdminScopes form that perform actions specific to Indexing Service.

-   [Removing a Scope](removing-a-scope.md)
-   [Starting a Full Rescan](starting-a-full-rescan.md)
-   [Starting an Incremental Rescan](starting-an-incremental-rescan.md)
