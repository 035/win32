# Summary of Tasks, Languages, APIs, and Tools

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The number of possible combinations of Indexing Service tasks, languages, APIs, and tools is large. Before trying to describe the combinations and the samples that illustrate them, it's best to first consider the components. The topics in this section summarize:

-   [Programming Tasks](programming-tasks.md)
-   [Programming Languages](programming-languages.md)
-   [Programming APIs](programming-apis.md)
-   [Programming Tools](programming-tools.md)
