# Controlling Filtering

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service provides several ways to customize the behavior of filtering on your system. The following sections describe how to do so:

-   [Filtering Directories](filtering-directories.md). The properties of file directories are indexed.
-   [Creating Abstracts](creating-abstracts.md). Document summary information is created during the filtering process.
-   [Maximum Retries](maximum-retries.md). The number of times Indexing Service tries to access an inaccessible file is determined.
-   [Corrupted Files](corrupted-files.md). Describes what occurs when Indexing Service tries to filter a corrupted file.
-   [Unknown Extensions](unknown-extensions.md). Explains what Indexing Service does if there is no association between file name extension and filter DLL.
