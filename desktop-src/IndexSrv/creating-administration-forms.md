# Creating Administration Forms

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

New with Indexing Service 3.0 are the administration scripting objects that allow you to programmatically manage Indexing Service through the **CatAdmin** catalog administration object methods and properties.

Legacy administration can still be accomplished through the ISAPI custom Internet Data Administration (.ida) files.

Manual administration is supplied through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in for Indexing Service. Programmatic administration is available through the [Indexing Service Administration Automation Objects](objects.md).
