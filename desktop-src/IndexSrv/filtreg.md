# FiltReg

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The FiltReg.exe program inspects filter installation information in the registry. You invoke the filtreg.exe program from the command line simply by typing its name:

**filtreg**

Filtreg.exe enumerates all file name extensions that have filters associated with them by printing the file name extension and the name of the filter DLL for the extension. This is a simple way to verify the correct installation of a filter.
