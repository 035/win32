# Filtering Component

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The Filtering component coordinates filtering of files. Its output is called a *word list*. This component is called by the Indexing component.

The CiDaemon.exe file contains the Filtering component. One executing instance of CiDaemon.exe exists for each Indexing Service catalog.
