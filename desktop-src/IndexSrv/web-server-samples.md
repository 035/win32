# Web Server Samples

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The web server samples illustrate dynamic HTML (DHTML) and Active Server Pages (ASP) scripting. The DHTML sample is written in HTML and includes client-side scripting. The ASP samples are written in HTML and include both client-side and server-side scripting. Both types of samples use the [Admin Helper](programming-apis.md#-idxs-admin-helper-api) API or the [Query Helper](programming-apis.md#-idxs-query-helper-api) API. The Platform SDK includes the following samples.

-   [IISAdmin Sample](iisadmin-sample.md). A set of HTML and ASP pages that manages Indexing Service using Internet Information Services (IIS).
-   [IISSearch Sample](iissearch-sample.md). A set of HTML and ASP pages that executes Indexing Service query language and structured query language (SQL) queries.
