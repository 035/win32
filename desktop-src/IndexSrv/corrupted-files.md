> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

If a file is corrupted, the filter may not be able to interpret the contents of that file properly. When this occurs, an event is written to the event log. Sometimes a file cannot be filtered because of a defective third-party filter. After verifying the contents of a file, an administrator should report problems to the filter vendor. Files protected by passwords are not filtered.
