Possessives are variations in a noun that indicate possession. English possessives are represented by appending an apostrophe (') or an apostrophe and an s ('s) to a word. For example, to indicate possession, the word "Mary" is represented as "Mary's." The word breaker generates both the apostrophe and the apostrophe-s forms at query time. Queries for "Mary" should match both "Mary" and "Mary's."
