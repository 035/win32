# Programming Tools

\[Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.\]

The phrase "programming tool" refers here to a variety of objects. It can be a development environment (such as Visual Studio) that produces an executable Indexing Service application. Or, it can be an execution environment (like Microsoft Internet Explorer or Windows Script Host) that hosts Indexing Service scripts. It can even be a complete service (such as IIS) that provides an integrated web server environment for Indexing Service.

The following table lists the major tools available for performing Indexing Service tasks and gives a brief description of each.
