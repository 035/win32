# String Variables Useful for Formatting Displayed Columns

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The variables in the following table, like those in the table in [Variables in Forms and in .Idq Files](variables-in-forms-and-in-idq-files.md), can be set in the .idq file. They cannot be referred to in the .htx file and can format only those columns whose type is vector or safe array.
