> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The IXSSO component normally produces a page containing errors encountered when executing Active Server Pages (.asp) queries. This page can point you to the problem that caused the error by using the Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Editing (VBScript) **OnError** statement and the standard VBScript **Err** object.

The following error messages are generated by the IXSSO component:



| Message                                                                                                                  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                             |

| Duplicate column, possibly by a column alias, found in the **Columns** property.                                         | The same column was named more than once in the *CiColumns* variable line. It may have been mentioned with different friendly names that refer to the same column.      |
| Invalid column name found in the **Columns** property.                                                                   | A value specified in the **Columns** property is not a standard property and was not defined by the **DefineColumn** method.                                            |
| An invalid locale identifier (LCID) was specified for the **LocaleID** property or the browser's Accept-Language header. | The LCID specified by the **LocaleID** property was not recognized as a valid locale ID.                                                                                |

| The property cannot be set while a query is active.                                                                      | You cannot change the value of a property while a query is being executed. Use the **Reset** method to reset the state of the query object before you set the property. |
| The **Query** property was not set.                                                                                      | The **Query** property is missing or empty. Every query must have a restriction. A restriction such as \#vpath \*.\* will match all pages.                              |
| A reserved tag was used in a query string.                                                                               | In the **SetQueryFromURL** method, a parameter name was given that is reserved for future use.                                                                          |
