# Formatting Considerations

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

You can specify the Webhits parameters in any order, and you can include white space in any of the following places:

-   After the question mark (?) and before the name of the Webhits parameter.
-   Between the name of the Webhits parameter and the equal sign (=).
-   Between the equal sign and the escaped value of the Webhits parameter.
-   After the escaped value of the Webhits parameter and the ampersand (&) (if more than one Webhits parameter is passed).
