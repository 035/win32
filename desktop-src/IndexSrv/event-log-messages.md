# Event Log Messages

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service system errors are reported in the application event log under the CiFilter service category. System errors reported here include page filtering (indexing) problems, out-of-resource conditions, index corruption, and so on. See also [Virtual Roots Errors](virtual-roots-errors.md).

The following messages are written to the Application Log of the Windows event log.
