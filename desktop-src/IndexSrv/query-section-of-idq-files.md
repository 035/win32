# Query Section of .Idq Files

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The query section of the .idq file specifies parameters that are used in the query. It can refer to form variables and can include conditional expressions to set a variable to alternative values depending upon some condition.

This topic contains the following topics:

-   [Sample Query Section](sample-query-section.md)
-   [Conditional Expressions](conditional-expressions.md)
-   [Security Considerations](security-considerations.md)
