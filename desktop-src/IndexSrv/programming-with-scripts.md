# Programming with Scripts

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Prior to Indexing Service 3.0, you typically had to perform most Indexing Service scripting tasks with Web-server tools such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Internet Information Services (IIS). With Indexing Service 3.0 you can perform file-system oriented tasks with scripts using Microsoft Windows Script Host as well as with several programming languages. With either of two scripting languages, Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or Microsoft JScript (JScript) development software, you can perform managing and querying tasks with Windows Script Host. This section includes the following sections that describe the use of the VBScript and JScript languages with the Windows Script Host.

-   [Using Visual Basic Scripting Edition with Indexing Service](using-visual-basic-scripting-edition-with-indexing-service.md)
-   [Using JScript with Indexing Service](using-jscript-with-indexing-service.md)

For information about using scripts with a Web-server tool, see [Using Indexing Service with Web Servers](using-indexing-service-with-web-servers.md). For examples of using scripts with web servers, see the scripts embedded in the [Web Server Samples](web-server-samples.md). For information about programming Indexing Service with applications, see [Programming with Applications](programming-with-applications.md).
