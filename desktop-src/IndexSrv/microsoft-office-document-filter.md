# Microsoft Office Document Filter

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This [IFilter](ifilter.md) implementation (in offilt.dll) filters files for the documents in Microsoft Office, including the documents for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These include files with the extensions .doc, .mdb, .ppt, and .xlt.
