# Command Trees

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Command trees in Indexing Service represent query strings and query restrictions. Command trees use data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements to represent the **SORT**, **PROJECT**, and **SELECT** parts of the query, as described in [Command Representation of Queries](command-representation-of-queries.md). DDL statements define tables and grant access privileges, while DML statements populate tables or delete rows.

The following topics describe the command tree in greater detail:

-   [Form of Command Tree](form-of-command-tree.md)
-   [Example of Command Tree](example-of-command-tree.md)
