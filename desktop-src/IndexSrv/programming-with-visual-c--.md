# Programming with Visual C++

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Visual C++ is the most powerful development language for Windows. With Visual C++ and the [OLE DB Provider API](programming-apis.md#-idxs-ole-db-provider-api) or the [OLE DB Helper API](programming-apis.md#-idxs-ole-db-helper-api), you can build high-performance applications that manage and query Indexing Service. This section describes the use of Visual C++ with Indexing Service and includes Visual C++ code examples. The topics include the following.

-   [Using Visual C++ with Indexing Service APIs](using-visual-c---with-indexing-service-apis.md)
-   [Managing with Visual C++](managing-with-visual-c--.md)
-   [Querying with Visual C++](querying-with-visual-c--.md)
