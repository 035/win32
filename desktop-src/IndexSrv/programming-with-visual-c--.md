# Programming with Visual C++

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Visual C++ is the most powerful development language for Windows. With Visual C++ and the [OLE DB Provider API](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OLE DB Provider API) or the [OLE DB Helper API](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OLE DB Helper API), you can build high-performance applications that manage and query Indexing Service. This section describes the use of Visual C++ with Indexing Service and includes Visual C++ code examples. The topics include the following.

-   [Using Visual C++ with Indexing Service APIs](using-visual-c---with-indexing-service-apis.md)
-   [Managing with Visual C++](managing-with-visual-c--.md)
-   [Querying with Visual C++](querying-with-visual-c--.md)
