> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

There are several sources of additional information about Indexing Service.

The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library contains several technical articles about Indexing Service:

-   Nareddy, Krishna, "Anatomy of a Search Solution," 1997.
-   Nareddy, Krishna, "Introduction to Microsoft Index Server," 1997.

-   Lee, David, "Using HTML Meta Properties with Microsoft Index Server," 1998.

The following two books contain information about using Index Server 2.0 with Internet Information Server 4.0.

-   Braginski, Leonid and Matthew Powell, *Running Microsoft Internet Information Server*, Microsoft Press, 1998.
