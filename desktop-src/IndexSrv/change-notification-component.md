# Change-Notification Component

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

The Change-Notification component informs Indexing Service when files have been altered (added, modified, deleted) to trigger indexing or re-indexing of the contents and values of changed files.

The Change-Notification component is part of the cisvc.exe file.
