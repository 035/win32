# Programming for Indexing Service

\[Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.\]

Programming for Indexing Service involves a flexible and diverse combination of languages, APIs, and tools for performing Indexing Service tasks. This section summarizes the available languages, APIs, and tools and describes the various combinations that apply to categories of tasks. It also summarizes the sample applications in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) that illustrate the combinations of task, languages, APIs, and tools.

This section includes:

-   [Summary of Tasks, Languages, APIs, and Tools](summary-of-tasks--languages--apis--and-tools.md)
-   [Combinations of Tasks, Languages, and APIs](combinations-of-tasks--languages--and-apis.md)
-   [Samples by Task, Language, API, and Tool](samples-by-task--language--api--and-tool.md)
