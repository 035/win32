# SQL Query Language

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/6da601c6-3742-40ad-99f2-8817f7f642b3) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

In addition to its own [Indexing Service Query Language](indexing-service-query-language.md), Indexing Service has supported queries in the SQL query language since Index Server 2.0. This provides expression of queries in a standard query language.

This section describes several features of the SQL query language and its extensions for Indexing Service. It consists of the following topics.

-   [Query Submittal for SQL Query Language](query-submittal-for-sql-query-language.md)
-   [Query Syntax of SQL Query Language](query-syntax-of-sql-query-language.md)
-   [Extensions to SQL for Indexing Service](extensions-to-sql-for-indexing-service.md)

For a reference to the SQL query language and its extensions, see [SQL Queries and SQL Extensions](sql-queries-and-sql-extensions.md).
