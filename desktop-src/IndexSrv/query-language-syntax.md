# Query-Language Syntax

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

Indexing Service APIs support queries on the results of indexing using the following two primary approaches.

-   [Query-Language Dialects](query-language-dialects.md). Query language designed specially for Indexing Service.
-   [SQL Queries and SQL Extensions](sql-queries-and-sql-extensions.md). Query extensions to structured query language (SQL) for use with Indexing Service and the standard OLE DB query language.

This section presents reference material for the two approaches. For additional information about these query approaches, see [Query Languages for Indexing Service](query-languages-for-indexing-service.md).
