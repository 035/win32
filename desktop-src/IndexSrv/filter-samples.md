# Filter Samples

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This section describes some individual sample filters in the Platform SDK. The following samples are listed in order of increasing complexity.

-   [SmpFilt Sample](smpfilt-sample.md). An example implementation of the [**IFilter**](ifilter.md) interface for unformatted, single-byte-character text files.
-   [IFilter Sample](ifilter-sample.md). An example implementation of the [**IFilter**](ifilter.md) interface that filters both text-type and value-type properties for HTML files.
-   [HtmlProp Sample](htmlprop-sample.md). An example implementation of the [**IFilter**](ifilter.md) interface that specializes the [HTML filter](html-filter.md) (HtmlFilt) implementation of Indexing Service to extract and convert HTML &lt;META&gt; tags to value-type properties.
