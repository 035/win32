# Displaying Results Correctly

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa965362) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258445) for server side search.

 

This section tells how you can make sure query results are displayed correctly both as a website administrator who expects queries from different locales and as a client querying a locale different from the HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE setting in your browser.

This section contains:

-   [Returning Results to a Different Locale](returning-results-to-a-different-locale.md)
-   [Querying a Site in a Different Locale](querying-a-site-in-a-different-locale.md)
