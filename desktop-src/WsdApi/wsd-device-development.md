# WSD Device Development

Device manufacturers and other device implementers can create devices that interoperate with Windows-based WSDAPI clients and hosts without using WSDAPI.

In addition to developing the device functionality, device implementers must implement the [Devices Profile for Web Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=59069) (DPWS). Devices that use the secure channel for communication must also implement a number of security-related requirements. These requirements are described in the topics [Secure WSD Client Development](secure-wsd-client-development.md) and [Secure WSD Device Development](secure-wsd-device-development.md).

Whenever possible, use WSDAPI to create a Windows-based WSD client or device host application. Using WSDAPI reduces the complexity of development and saves time. For more information, see [WSD Application Development on Windows](wsd-application-development-on-windows.md).
