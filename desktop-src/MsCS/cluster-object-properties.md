# Cluster Object Properties

Properties are attributes that describe a [cluster object](cluster-objects.md). The values assigned to an object's properties determine the identity, location, and behavior of the object in the [*cluster*](c-gly.md#-wolf-cluster-gly).

Properties are distinguished by the following attributes:

-   [Property scope](property-scope.md) (common, private, or unknown)
-   [Property access](property-access.md) (read-only or read/write)

For factors that may limit the size of individual properties, see [Maximum Property Size](maximum-string-size.md).

The [Failover Cluster API Reference](server-cluster-api-reference.md) provides several different structures and tools for working with cluster properties. For more information, see [Data Structures, Lists, and Tables](data-structures-lists-and-tables.md).
