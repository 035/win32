# Property Scope

Given an [object](cluster-objects.md) with a particular [property](cluster-object-properties.md), the scope of the property indicates whether other objects of the same type can be expected to possess the same property, and affects which APIs are used to work with the property.

The three different kinds of scope are described in the following sections:

-   [Common Properties](common-properties.md)
-   [Private Properties](private-properties.md)
-   [Unknown Properties](unknown-properties.md)
