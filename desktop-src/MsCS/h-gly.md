Message that is sent regularly between [*cluster network drivers*](c-gly.md#-wolf-cluster-network-driver-gly) on each [*node*](n-gly.md#-wolf-node-gly). Heartbeat messages are used to detect communication failure between cluster nodes.

Describes a resource that remains operational and usable by clients most of the time with a very low percentage of failures that interrupt service. [*Failover clusters*](f-gly.md#mscs-failover-cluster-gly) are designed to keep applications and other cluster [*resources*](r-gly.md#-wolf-resource-gly) highly available.
