# Failover Cluster Automation Server Reference

\[The [Failover Cluster Automation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa372940) is available for use in Windows Server 2008. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.\]

The Microsoft [Failover Cluster Automation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa372940), MSClus.dll, exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) objects to high-level and scripting languages. Cluster Automation Server lets you quickly and easily create a [failover cluster management application](cluster-management-applications.md) using the properties and methods associated with each Failover Cluster Automation Server object.

The Failover Cluster Automation Server reference is organized according to the following table. For more information on the relationships between objects, see [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md).
