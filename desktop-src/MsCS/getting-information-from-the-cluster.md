# Getting Information From the Cluster

Each [cluster object](cluster-objects.md), including the [*cluster*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*cluster*) itself, is associated with several pieces of information that describe the object's identity, configuration, and relationships to other objects. Accessing this information can be broken down into tasks which are presented in the following topics.



| Topic                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Enumerating Objects](enumerating-objects.md)               | Describes the process of listing objects that are related to another object in some way. For example, listing the [nodes](nodes.md) in a cluster, the [resources](resources.md) in a [group](groups.md), or the [dependents](resource-dependencies.md) of a resource. |
| [Getting Object States](getting-object-states.md)           | Describes how to obtain the current state of an object. An object's state indicates its operational status and availability with respect to the cluster.                                                                                                                  |
| [Getting Object Properties](getting-object-properties.md)   | Describes how to retrieve the properties of an object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Getting Object Information](getting-object-information.md) | Lists the most common information-retrieval tasks and the API elements that support them.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
