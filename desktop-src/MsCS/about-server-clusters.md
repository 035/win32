# About Failover Clusters

A failover cluster is one of two types of clusters included as part of Windows Clustering. A failover cluster is characterized by highly available resources. The Failover Cluster API allows you to create and support robust, cluster-aware resources for the failover cluster environment.

The following sections describe failover cluster architecture and implementation.

Note that the information in all of the sections listed above is also presented in the documentation included with the operating system. If you are already familiar with how a failover cluster operates, you might want to start with either the [Failover Cluster API](the-server-cluster-api.md) or the [Cluster Automation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa372940).
