# Property Access

A [property's](cluster-object-properties.md) access indicates the kinds of operations that can be used to change the value of the property. On the basis of access, properties can be divided into the following two groups:

-   [Read-only properties](read-only-properties.md)
-   [Read/Write properties](read-write-properties.md)
