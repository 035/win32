# Creating Setup Applications for Resource Types

A [*cluster-aware*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*cluster-aware*) setup application typically deploys one or more [resource types](resource-types.md) and provides the administrator with some degree of assistance in configuring some initial instances of those types.

The installation process can be divided into the following logical steps, each described in one of the following topics:

-   [Installing Files](installing-files.md)
-   [Registering Resource Types](registering-resource-types.md)
-   [Initializing Groups](initializing-groups.md)
