# Using the Code Examples

This documentation makes a distinction between code examples and code samples.

-   *Code examples* are embedded in many topics of the Failover Cluster documentation. Code examples are typically task-oriented, single-purpose procedures.
-   *Code samples* are one or more independent project files that are installed in the samples directory. Typically, code samples are fully-functional applications consisting of several files.

The following conventions apply to all inline code examples provided by the Failover Cluster documentation.

-   Most functions, macros, structures, constants, filenames, and other named objects defined by the documentation itself are prefixed by "ClusDocEx" (cluster documentation example). Any code object whose name begins with "ClusDocEx" should not be considered part of the Failover Cluster APIs.
-   Wherever possible, each example is presented as one or more complete, single-purpose functions that accomplish one task.
-   The functions are designed to be modular, allowing you to cut and paste them in various combinations to perform larger tasks.

Refer to the following sections.

-   For an index of links to the inline examples, see [Index of Examples](index-of-examples.md).
-   If you want to cut, paste, and compile and run an inline example, see [ClusDocEx.h](clusdocex-h.md).
