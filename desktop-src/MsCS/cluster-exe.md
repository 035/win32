# Cluster.exe

\[Cluster.exe is available for use in the following versions of Windows: Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use failover cluster cmdlets.\]

Cluster.exe is a command-line interface for administering [*failover clusters*](f-gly.md#mscs-failover-cluster-gly). For a list of available commands, type "cluster /?" in a command prompt window or see [Managing a Server Cluster from the Command Line](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc779044.aspx).

**Note**  When you use cluster.exe to create a new File Share resource, permissions for the Everyone group for that file share are set to full control by default. You can change the default permissions by modifying the [Security Property for File Shares](file-shares-security.md).
