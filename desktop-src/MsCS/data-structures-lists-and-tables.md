# Data Structures, Lists, and Tables

The [Failover Cluster API](the-server-cluster-api.md) defines a number of ways to arrange multiple heterogeneous values (such as string and **DWORD** values) in the same buffer, and to assign a meaning or context to each value (such as a property name or a list terminator). This allows complex sets of data, such as the properties of a typical object, to be arranged in a buffer and passed as a single unit between functions.

The following sections describe the architecture of data structures, lists, and tables.

-   [About Data Structures](about-data-structures.md)
-   [Value Lists](value-lists.md)
-   [Property Lists](property-lists.md)
-   [Parameter Blocks](parameter-blocks.md)
-   [Property Tables](property-tables.md)
