# Failover Cluster Administrator Extension DLLs

\[Support for the Failover Cluster Administrator was removed in Windows Server 2008.\]

Failover Cluster Administrator extension DLLs (also called "extension DLLs" or just "extensions") extend the functionality of [Failover Cluster Administrator](cluster-administrator.md) to support new types of [cluster objects](cluster-objects.md). Third-party developers implement extension DLLs to add context menus, property sheets, and wizard pages to the Failover Cluster Administrator user interface. Typically, extension DLLs are created as part of creating a [resource type](resource-types.md), but extensions can be created for any cluster object. For more information, see [Implementing Extension DLLs](implementing-extension-dlls.md).
