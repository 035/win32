# Remote Differential Compression Reference

Remote Differential Compression (RDC) provides COM interfaces that enable synchronization between two locations with an efficient use of bandwidth.

RDC supports synchronizing data between a local and remote computer without passing all of the data over the network. [Distributed file system replication (DFSR)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb540031) synchronizes files by using RDC.

The RDC reference section contains detailed information about the following API elements:

-   [Remote Differential Compression Enumerations](remote-differential-compression-enumerations.md)
-   [Remote Differential Compression Interfaces](remote-differential-compression-interfaces.md)
-   [Remote Differential Compression Structures](remote-differential-compression-structures.md)
