# Notifying the User

To notify the user that some kind of error has occurred, many applications simply produce a sound by using the [**MessageBeep**](messagebeep.md) function or flash the window by using either the [**FlashWindow**](flashwindow.md) or [**FlashWindowEx**](flashwindowex.md) function. An application can also use these functions to call attention to an error and then display a message box or an error message containing details about the error.
