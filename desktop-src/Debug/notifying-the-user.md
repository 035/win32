# Notifying the User

To notify the user that some kind of error has occurred, many applications simply produce a sound by using the [**MessageBeep**](/windows/win32/WinUser/nf-winuser-messagebeep?branch=master) function or flash the window by using either the [**FlashWindow**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-flashwindow?branch=master) or [**FlashWindowEx**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-flashwindowex?branch=master) function. An application can also use these functions to call attention to an error and then display a message box or an error message containing details about the error.
