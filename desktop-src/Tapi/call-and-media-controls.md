# Call and Media Controls

The following material provides a general review of the TAPI 3 call and media controls objects, interfaces, and methods for building end-user and server communications applications. [About Call And Media Controls](about-call-and-media-controls.md) describes the main objects and contains a hyperlinked diagram showing both objects and interfaces. [Using Call and Media Controls](using-call-and-media-controls.md) covers more specific information useful in writing applications, such as the .lib files required to compile and some code examples.

For more information, see the [Call and Media Controls Reference](call-and-media-controls-reference.md).
