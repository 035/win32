# Monitoring

Monitoring is a service-provider defined feature that detects signals that indicate other media. For example, one application can be playing an outgoing "leave a message" voice message while the incoming call starts sending a fax "calling" tone and waits for a handshake. In order not to lose the fax call, the local application monitors for this tone while playing the voice message.

Monitoring comprises [media monitoring](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725242), [digit monitoring](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725185), and [tone monitoring](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725520).
