# RSM MMC Snap-in

\[[Removable Storage Manager](removable-storage-manager.md) is no longer available as of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\]

The RSM MMC snap-in is an administrative interface to RSM that is a snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Administrators can use the snap-in to insert and eject media, perform inventories, mount and dismount media, clean drives and check status information. RSM objects can be physical objects (such as libraries, drives, and media) or groups of media (called media pools).

Typical users should never be required to use the snap-in because each RSM client application takes care of routine tasks. For example, a simple backup application should not require a user to go to the snap-in to place media in a drive. In general, administrative support should only be required if a system is running more than one RSM client application, backup and a document management system, for example, or the system has a sophisticated robotic library that requires administrative management.

The MMC snap-in can help administrators perform the following tasks:

-   Complete or refuse operator requests
-   Point and click operations such as inserting media, ejecting media, drive cleaning, and dismounting media, moving media from one pool to another
-   Cancel work queue items
-   Enable and disable drives and libraries
