# Developing a Media Label Library

A *media label library* (MLL) is a DLL that can parse a tape label and find certain information within the label that uniquely identifies the tape. RSM passes labels to each MLL, and an MLL will pass back on-media identifier (OMID) information for each media it can parse.
