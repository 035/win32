# RSM Basic Concepts

\[[Removable Storage Manager](removable-storage-manager.md) is no longer available as of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\]

Removable Storage Manager can be described in terms of the following basic concepts:

-   [Media](media.md)
-   [Media life cycle](media-life-cycle.md)
-   [Libraries](libraries.md)
-   [Media pools](media-pools.md)
-   [Library requests](library-requests.md)
-   [Operator requests](operator-requests.md)

The most fundamental concept is media; it is the basis of the other concepts.
