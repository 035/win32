# RSM Database

\[[Removable Storage Manager](removable-storage-manager.md) is no longer available as of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\]

The RSM database contains information about the objects in an RSM system. RSM maintains the data in the database and updates it whenever the administrator, an application, or a device makes a change in an RSM system. For example, if the administrator wants to mount a piece of media in a library, RSM mounts the media and updates the database to reflect the change. The database includes the following information:

-   Library, drive, and media configuration and state
-   Media pool configuration and contents
-   Library requests
-   Operator requests
