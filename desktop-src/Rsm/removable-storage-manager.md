# Removable Storage Manager

\[Removable Storage Manager is no longer available as of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\]

Removable Storage Manager (RSM) facilitates communication among applications, robotic changers, and media libraries. It enables multiple applications to share local robotic media libraries and tape or disk drives, and manage removable media within a single-server system. A group of libraries, drives, and media that are managed by RSM is called an RSM system. RSM can help you create an application that makes effective use of the media resources in an RSM system.
