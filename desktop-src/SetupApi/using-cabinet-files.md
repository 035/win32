# Using Cabinet Files

The setup functions handle cabinets internally. To explicitly enumerate and extract files from a cabinet, you can call the [**SetupIterateCabinet**](setupiteratecabinet.md) function.

The following topic describes the cabinet processing internal to the setup functions and how to use [**SetupIterateCabinet**](setupiteratecabinet.md). Also discussed are the notifications sent by **SetupIterateCabinet** and the required format of a cabinet callback routine to process those notifications.
