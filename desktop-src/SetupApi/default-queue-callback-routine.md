# Default Queue Callback Routine

Included with the setup functions is a default callback routine, [**SetupDefaultQueueCallback**](/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdefaultqueuecallbacka), that you can use to process notifications returned by [**SetupCommitFileQueue**](/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupcommitfilequeuea).

The following sections discuss the format of the default queue callback routine, using the default queue callback routine with [**SetupCommitFileQueue**](/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupcommitfilequeuea), and how to create a filter callback routine that builds on the functionality provided by the default queue callback routine.
