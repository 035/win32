# Palette Awareness

Your application must respond to the [WM\_PALETTECHANGED](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145214), [WM\_QUERYNEWPALETTE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145218), and [WM\_ACTIVATE](https://www.bing.com/search?q=WM\_ACTIVATE) messages to be aware of and use palettes. Design your application to select and realize palettes in response to these messages.

For more information on palettes and palette awareness, see the articles "Palette Awareness," and "The Palette Manager: How and Why" on the Microsoft Developer Network Development Library compact discs.
