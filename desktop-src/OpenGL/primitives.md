# Primitives

During the next stage of processing, primitives are converted to pixel fragments in the following steps:

-   Primitives are clipped appropriately.
-   Necessary corresponding adjustments are made to the color and texture data, and the relevant coordinates are transformed to window coordinates.
-   Rasterization converts the clipped primitives to pixel fragments.

For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Clipping](clipping.md)
-   [Transforming to Window Coordinates](transforming-to-window-coordinates.md)
-   [Rasterizing](rasterizing.md)
-   [Primitives Reference](primitives-reference.md)
