# iSCSI WMI Common Structures

## 

The iSCSI WMI structures that are described in this section provide general definitions that are used by all iSCSI classes. The WMI tool suite generates declarations for these structures in the *Iscsidef.h* file when it compiles *Common.mof*.

This section describes the following structures:
