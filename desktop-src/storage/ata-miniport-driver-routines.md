# ATA Miniport Driver Routines

## 

> [!Note]  
> The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.

 

ATA miniport driver routines are grouped into the following two basic categories:

<dl>

[ATA Controller Interface Routines](ata-controller-interface-routines.md)  
[ATA Channel Interface Routines](ata-channel-interface-routines.md)  
</dl>
