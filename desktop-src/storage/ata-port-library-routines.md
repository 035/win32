# ATA Port Library Routines

## 

> [!Note]  
> The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.

 

The ATA Port library routines fall into the following categories:

[ATA Port Routines for PCI Config Space Access](ata-port-routines-for-pci-config-space-access.md)  
[ATA Port Routines for Processing I/O Requests](ata-port-routines-for-processing-i-o-requests.md)  
[ATA Port Callback Routines](ata-port-callback-routines.md)  
[ATA Port Routines that Report a Configuration Change](ata-port-routines-that-report-a-configuration-change.md)  
[ATA Port Routines to Control Request Queues](ata-port-routines-to-control-request-queues.md)  
[ATA Port Utility Routines](ata-port-utility-routines.md)  
[ATA Port Debug and Error Reporting Routines](ata-port-debug-and-error-reporting-routines.md)
