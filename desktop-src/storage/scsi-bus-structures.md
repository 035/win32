# SCSI Bus Structures

## 

This section describes structures used by SCSI miniport drivers that are linked with a Microsoft-supplied, operating-system-specific SCSI port driver. SCSI miniport drivers drive SCSI adapters.

This section also contains structures used by storage class, miniclass, and filter drivers. For further information about storage structures, see [Storage Structures](storage-structures-and-enumerations.md).

Structures described in this section are in alphabetical order.

> [!Note]  
> The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.
