# NV Cache Manager I/O Control Codes

Microsoft ReadyDrive technology in Windows Vista enables the operating system to effectively use hybrid-hard disk drives (H-HDDs). An H-HDD is a hard drive that includes both rotating media and an integrated cache of nonvolatile (NV) flash memory. This cache buffers disk write operations and enables the disk drive to stay spun down for longer periods of time to increase both battery life and the overall reliability of the drive, particularly in mobile systems. Satisfying disk read and write operations from the NV cache also increases the performance of the boot and resume processes, as well as memory-intensive applications by avoiding the latency of random disk I/O.
