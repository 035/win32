# SCSI Port Library Routines

## 

An operating system-specific SCSI port driver provides **ScsiPort***Xxx* routines to support operating system-independent SCSI miniport drivers that are linked with a Microsoft-supplied, operating system-specific SCSI port driver.

The SCSI port driver is a kernel-mode dynamic-link library.

References for the **ScsiPort***Xxx* routines are in alphabetical order.

> [!Note]  
> The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.
