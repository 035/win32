# Installing Side-by-side Assemblies

You may install side-by-side assemblies as [shared assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa371839) or as [private assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa370850). For more information, see [Installing Side-by-Side Assemblies as Private Assemblies](installing-side-by-side-assemblies-as-private-assemblies.md) and [Installing Side-by-side Assemblies as Shared Assemblies](installing-side-by-side-assemblies-as-shared-assemblies.md).

Note that:

-   Assemblies installed to the global assembly cache by an installation using the per-user [installation context](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd765197) are not protected by Windows File Protection.
-   Assemblies that are installed to the global assembly cache by an installation using the per-machine [installation context](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd765197) are protected by Windows File Protection.
