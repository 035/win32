# About the Cloud Backup Provider API

A cloud backup provider is a third-party provider of networked online storage services. Windows Server Backup provides for integration of cloud backup provider status within the Windows Server Backup MMC snap-in.

For information about MMC, see [Microsoft Management Console 3.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=224494).

The cloud backup provider snap-in is a child snap-in under the Windows Server Backup parent snap-in. The cloud backup provider snap-in should be an extensible snap-in and must register itself with Windows Server Backup as described in [Cloud Backup Provider API Registry Keys](windows-server-backup-cloud-backup-provider-api-registry-keys.md).
