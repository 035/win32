# Kernel Callback Functions

## 

This section provides reference pages for callback functions that are implemented in a DirectDraw driver to synchronize surface and VPE object data with a [video miniport driver](https://www.bing.com/search?q=video miniport driver). The DirectDraw driver supplies these callback functions when the GUID\_KernelCallbacks GUID is passed to its [**DdGetDriverInfo**](/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverinfo) function.
