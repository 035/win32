# Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) Reference

## 

This section contains reference pages that apply to printer drivers and to drivers in the Microsoft Windows 2000 display driver model (XDDM), but not to drivers in the Windows Vista display driver model (WDDM).

> [!Note]  
> XDDM and VGA drivers will not compile on Windows 8 and later versions. If display hardware is attached to a Windows 8 computer without a driver that is certified to support Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 or later, the system defaults to running the Microsoft Basic Display Driver.
