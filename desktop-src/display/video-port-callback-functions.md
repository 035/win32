# Video Port Callback Functions

## 

This section provides reference pages for callback functions that are implemented in a DirectDraw driver for video port operations. The DirectDraw driver supplies these callback functions when the GUID\_VideoPortCallbacks GUID is passed to its [**DdGetDriverInfo**](ddgetdriverinfo.md) function.
