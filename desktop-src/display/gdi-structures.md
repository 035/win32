# GDI Structures

## 

GDI, printer drivers, and display drivers in the Microsoft Windows 2000 display driver model create and maintain several structures as a means of defining objects, passing data, storing flag settings, and so on. This section describes these structures. [GDI Support for Graphics Drivers](display.gdi_support_for_graphics_drivers) lists the include files that contain definitions of these structures.

Reference material for functions that are implemented by printer drivers and/or display drivers (Windows 2000 model) can be found in [GDI Functions Implemented by Printer and Display Drivers](gdi-functions-implemented-by-printer-and-display-drivers.md). The system-supplied GDI services that can be called by graphics drivers are documented in [GDI Functions Called by Printer and Display Drivers](gdi-functions-called-by-printer-and-display-drivers.md).

Display adapter drivers that run on Windows Vista can adhere to one of two models: the Windows Vista display driver model or the Windows 2000 display driver model. The structures documented in this section are used by printer drivers and by drivers in the Windows 2000 display driver model, but they are not used by drivers in the Windows Vista display driver model.
