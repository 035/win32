# NT-based Callback Functions

## 

This section provides reference pages for callback functions that are implemented in an NT-based DirectDraw driver. The DirectDraw driver supplies these callback functions when the GUID\_NTCallbacks GUID is passed to its [**DdGetDriverInfo**](/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverinfo) function.
