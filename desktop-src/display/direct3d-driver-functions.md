## 

The following sections provide reference pages for Microsoft Direct3D driver functions and callbacks:

<dl>

[Direct3D Driver-Supplied Functions](direct3d-driver-supplied-functions.md)  
[Direct3D Driver Support Functions](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Direct3D+Driver+Support+Functions)  
</dl>

[Direct3D DDI](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Direct3D+DDI) lists the header file that contains Direct3D function prototypes and also contains information for writing a Direct3D driver.

For Direct3D data structure definitions, see [Direct3D Driver Structures](direct3d-driver-structures.md).
