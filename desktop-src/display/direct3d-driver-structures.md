# Direct3D Driver Structures

## 

The following sections describe the Direct3D driver structures:

<dl>

[D3DNTHAL\_Xxx Structures](d3dnthal-xxx-structures.md)  
<dl> The D3DNTHAL\_Xxx structure form is used in code for drivers that are used on Windows 2000 and later.  
D3DNTHAL\_Xxx structures are defined in d3dnthal.h.  
</dl> </dd> [D3DHAL\_Xxx Structures](d3dhal-xxx-structures.md)<dl> The D3DHAL\_Xxx structure form is used in code for drivers that are used on Windows 98/Me.  
D3DHAL\_Xxx structures are defined in d3dhal.h.  
</dl>

</dd> [Other Direct3D Driver Structures](other-direct3d-driver-structures.md)<dl> Direct3D driver structures that do not begin with D3DHAL\_ (for example, device-description and **GetDriverInfo2-query** structures).  
</dl>

</dd> </dl>

[Direct3D](display.direct3d) lists the include files that contain Direct3D structure definitions and also contains information for writing a Direct3D driver.
