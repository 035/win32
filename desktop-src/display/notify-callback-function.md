# Notify Callback Function

## 

This section provides a reference page for a notify callback function that is implemented in a video capture driver. The video capture driver supplies such a function to the DirectDraw runtime when the video capture driver calls the runtime's [**DxApi**](dxapi.md) function for certain operations. For more information, see [Notify Callback Functions in a Video Capture Driver](display.notify_callback_functions_in_a_video_capture_driver).
