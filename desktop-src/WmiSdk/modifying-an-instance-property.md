# Modifying an Instance Property

After you create or locate an instance of a class, you probably want to modify the instance. For example, you may wish to change the name of the system name stored in the local instance of the [**Win32\_ComputerSystem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa394102) class. The most common way to update an instance is to update the entire instance. For more information, see [Updating an Entire Instance](updating-an-entire-instance.md). The second option is to update only part of the instance. For more information, see [Updating Part of an Instance](updating-part-of-an-instance.md).

For more information about working with classes, see [Manipulating Class and Instance Information](manipulating-class-and-instance-information.md).
