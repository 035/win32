# \_\_SystemClass class

The **\_\_SystemClass** abstract system class is the base class from which most system classes derive. Instances of this class cannot be created.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties. Properties are listed in alphabetic order, not MOF order.

## Syntax

``` syntax
[abstract]
class __SystemClass
{
};
```

## Members

The **\_\_SystemClass** class does not define any members.
