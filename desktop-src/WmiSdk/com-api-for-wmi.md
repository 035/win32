# COM API for WMI

You can use the WMI Component Object Model (COM) API to write management client applications or create a new WMI [*provider*](gloss-p.md#wmi-gloss-provider). The COM API reference provides information for advanced system administrators, as well as developers who are writing client and provider applications.

For more information about writing WMI enterprise management applications, see [Creating a WMI Application Using C++](creating-a-wmi-application-using-c-.md). For more information about how to write a WMI provider, see [Providing Data to WMI](providing-data-to-wmi.md).

> [!Note]  
> WMI only supports C++ development using Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 and later development systems. However, you can also use other compilers such as those from Borland and Watcom.

Â 

Each of the different WMI objects inherit from an interface ultimately inherited from the [**IUnknown**](_com_iunknown) interface. COM dictates how object implementers, or interfaces, handle tasks such as memory management, parameter management, and multithreading. By conforming to COM, the COM API for WMI ensures that it supports the functionality provided by the interfaces of each WMI object.

WMI is accessed through the following WMI-specific COM interfaces.



| Interface                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
