# About Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) API provides a mechanism for connecting to, searching, and modifying Internet directories.

The LDAP guide documents the functions and data structures that constitute the LDAP 3 API draft Internet Standard as proposed in RFC 2251, as well as several Microsoft extensions to the LDAP API. The reference is intended for experienced C programmers and can be used to enable new or existing applications to connect to, search, and update LDAP servers.
