# Accessing Directory Information

The LDAP API provides functions that allow LDAP client applications to search for and retrieve information from an LDAP directory server, as well as functions for modifying directory entries, where such modifications are permitted. There are also functions that provide access control for servers, by allowing clients to authenticate themselves. For more information on these functions, see the [Using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](using-the-ldap-api-in-a-client-application.md) topics.
