# LDAP\_CAP\_ACTIVE\_DIRECTORY\_LDAP\_INTEG\_OID

The LDAP\_CAP\_ACTIVE\_DIRECTORY\_LDAP\_INTEG\_OID can be present in the **supportedCapabilities** attribute of the rootDSE of an Active Directory server.

The LDAP\_CAP\_ACTIVE\_DIRECTORY\_LDAP\_INTEG\_OID, which is defined as "1.2.840.113556.1.4.1791", indicates that the LDAP server is capable of signing and sealing on an NTLM authenticated connection, and that the server is capable of performing subsequent binds on a signed or sealed connection.
