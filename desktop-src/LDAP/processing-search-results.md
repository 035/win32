# Processing Search Results

Directories are becoming the primary platform for data organization and retrieval within a networked environment. Functioning as the front-end for databases and in some cases as limited databases themselves, directories and the services provided for their use and control are integral to any client/server information system.

Most interactions between a client and a server within a directory service is search. The processing of directory service search results is performed through a variety of functions and controls. The following topics enumerate, describe, and link to the primary search result processing methods through the various functions and controls:

-   [Paging Search Results](paging-search-results.md)
-   [Sorting Search Results](sorting-search-results.md)
-   [Searching with the LDAP VLV Control](searching-with-the-ldap-vlv-control.md)
