# Monitor Configuration

You can use the monitor configuration functions to get information from a monitor and to change a monitor's settings. You can use these functions to :

-   Change a monitor's geometry settings, such as the width and height of the display.
-   Change image settings, such as brightness and contrast.
-   Reset a monitor's settings to their factory defaults.
-   Degauss the monitor.

Internally, the monitor configuration functions use the Display Data Channel Command Interface (DDC/CI) to send commands to the monitor.

The monitor configuration functions are documented in the following sections:

-   [About Monitor Configuration](about-monitor-configuration.md)
-   [Using Monitor Configuration](using-monitor-configuration.md)
-   [Monitor Configuration Reference](monitor-configuration-reference.md)
