# Dictionaries

Dictionaries allow tokenization of common node data such as element / attribute names, namespaces and common text within a binary XML format.

## 

A [**Dictionary&gt;**](ws-xml-dictionary.md) can be specified as part of the [**WS\_XML\_STRING**](ws-xml-string.md) type. All strings within a single **Dictionary&gt;** must be unique.

Dictionary ID's are supported for all encodings (not just the binary XML format).

The following function is used with dictionaries:

-   [**WsGetDictionary**](wsgetdictionary.md)
