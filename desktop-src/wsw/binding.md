# Channel Binding

Bindings specify the wire protocol and local behavior for a channel. Bindings are made up of the following components:

-   A [**WS\_CHANNEL\_BINDING**](ws-channel-binding.md), which identifies the transfer protocol to use.
-   A [**WS\_SECURITY\_DESCRIPTION**](ws-security-description.md), which specifies how to secure the channel.
-   A set [**WS\_CHANNEL\_PROPERTY**](ws-channel-property.md)s, which specify additional optional settings (see also [**WS\_CHANNEL\_PROPERTY\_ID**](ws-channel-property-id.md)).
