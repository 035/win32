# Unifying the Discovery Process

\[Function Discovery is available for use in the following versions of Windows: Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.\]

One of the most powerful features of Function Discovery is the unification of discovery across the following aspects:

-   Hardware (directly connected or across the network)
-   Legacy discovery systems
-   Functionality

The Function Discovery API performs two main functions:

-   Queries for one or more [function instances](function-objects.md). Providers return information that is used to respond to the client queries.
-   Sends notifications to clients.
