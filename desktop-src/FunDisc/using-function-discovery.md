# Using Function Discovery

\[Function Discovery is available for use in the following versions of Windows: Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.\]

Function Discovery is an application programming interface (API) for discovering resources connected to the local computer or across the network.

The types of resources that can be discovered through Function Discovery, and the span in which they can be discovered, is limited only by the discovery providers installed on the system. For more information, see [Built-in Providers](built-in-providers.md).

The Function Discovery Browser demonstrates the capabilities of the Function Discovery API. For more information, see [Using the Function Discovery Browser](using-the-function-discovery-browser.md).

The Function Discovery core implements the object model and logic. It also exposes the client API used by clients to discover resources. For more information on using the API, see the following topics:
