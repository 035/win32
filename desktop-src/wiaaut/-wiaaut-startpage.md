# Windows Image Acquisition Automation Layer

## Purpose

The Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Automation Layer is a full-featured image manipulation component that provides end-to-end image processing capabilities. The WIA Automation Layer makes it easy to acquire images from digital cameras, scanners, or Web cameras, and to rotate, scale, and annotate your image files. The WIA Automation Layer supersedes the [WIA Scripting Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms630203(VS.85).aspx) provided by Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) 1.0.

## Developer audience

The WIA Automation Layer API is designed for use by Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, Active Server Pages (ASP), and scripting programmers.

## Run-time requirements

Applications that use the WIA Automation Layer API require Windows Vista  or later. Earlier versions of Windows are not supported.
