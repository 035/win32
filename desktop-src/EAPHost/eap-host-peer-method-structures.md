# EAPHost Peer Method Structures

The EAPHost Peer Method API structures are as follows.



| Structure                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [**EapCertificateCredential**](eapcertificatecredential.md)           | Contains information about the certificate that the EAP method uses for authentication.                                                                                                            |

| [**EAP\_PEER\_METHOD\_ROUTINES**](eap-peer-method-routines.md)        | Contains a set of function pointers to the EAPHost Peer Method APIs.                                                                                                                               |
| [**EapPeerMethodOutput**](eappeermethodoutput.md)                     | Contains the action information returned by an EAP peer method.                                                                                                                                    |
| [**EapPeerMethodResult**](eappeermethodresult.md)                     | Contains result data generated by an EAP method during authentication.                                                                                                                             |
| [**EapSimCredential**](eapsimcredential.md)                           | Contains information about the SIM that is used by the EAP method for authentication.                                                                                                              |
| [**EapUsernamePasswordCredential**](eapusernamepasswordcredential.md) | Contains the username and password that is used by the EAP method for authenticating the user.                                                                                                     |
