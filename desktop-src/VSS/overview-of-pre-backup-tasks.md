# Overview of Pre-Backup Tasks

Pre-backup tasks under VSS are focused on creating a shadow copy of the volumes containing data for backup. The backup application will save data from the shadow copy, not the actual volume. For more information, see [Overview of Processing a Backup Under VSS](overview-of-processing-a-backup-under-vss.md).

Requesters typically wait for writers to prepare for backup and creating the shadow copy. The writer must determine if it is to participate in the backup and, if it is, configure its files and itself to be ready for backup and shadow copy. The following table shows the sequence of actions and events that are required to prepare for a backup operation.

## Requester Pre-Backup Tasks

In addition, before creating a [**IVssBackupComponents::PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master) event, a requester may also set backup options for individual writers using [**IVssBackupComponents::SetBackupOptions**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setbackupoptions?branch=master) depending on the specifics of each writer and whether a requester is aware of them.

To support incremental and differential operations, requesters may at this point choose to examine components for time stamps of earlier backup operation (using [**IVssComponent::GetBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getbackupstamp?branch=master)) and use that information to set a previous time stamp for a writer to process (using [**IVssBackupComponents::SetPreviousBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setpreviousbackupstamp?branch=master)). See [Incremental and Differential Backups](incremental-and-differential-backups.md) for more information.

A requester can now direct the system's writers to complete pre-backup preparations and to handle the creation of a shadow copy.

First, the requester generates a [**PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master) event by calling [**IVssBackupComponents::PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master).

After all participating writers return from handling the [**PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master) event (which a requester determines by using the instance of the [**IVssAsync**](/windows/win32/Vss/nn-vss-ivssasync?branch=master) interface returned by **PrepareForBackup**), the requester can initiate the shadow copy by calling [**IVssBackupComponents::DoSnapshotSet**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-dosnapshotset?branch=master), which, as it progresses, will generate [*PrepareForSnapshot*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-preparesnapshot-event), [*Freeze*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-freeze-event), [*Thaw*](vssgloss-t.md#base-vssgloss-thaw-event), and [*PostSnapshot*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-postsnapshot-event) events for the writers to handle.

There are some cases where a requester may not need to create a shadow copy. Specifically, each [*file set*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-file-set) managed by one of a given writer's components has a File Specification Backup mask (indicated by a bitwise OR of [**VSS\_FILE\_SPEC\_BACKUP\_TYPE**](/windows/win32/Vss/ne-vss-_vss_file_spec_backup_type?branch=master) values) set during the [*Identify*](vssgloss-i.md#base-vssgloss-postsnapshot-event) event. This mask specifies, among other things, whether a file set requires the system to be shadow copied before its backup is performed.

If no file sets to be backed up on any volumes require a shadow copy, then [**IVssBackupComponents::DoSnapshotSet**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-dosnapshotset?branch=master) need not be called.

## Writer Pre-Backup Tasks

When handling the [**PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master) event, VSS will call each writer's [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareBackup**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparebackup?branch=master) method, a virtual method, which by default simply returns true.

Writers can override this default implementation and use the handling to find information about the upcoming backup and take action.

A writer can determine information about the sort of backup operation contemplated by using the following methods:

1.  [**CVssWriter::GetBackupType**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-getbackuptype?branch=master)
2.  [**CVssWriter::IsBootableStateBackedUp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-isbootablesystemstatebackedup?branch=master)
3.  [**CVssWriter::AreComponentsSelected**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-arecomponentsselected?branch=master)

A writer determines if the files it manages will be involved in the shadow copy by using [**CVssWriter::IsPathAffected**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-ispathaffected?branch=master).

More important, when VSS calls the [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareBackup**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparebackup?branch=master) method, it passes in an instance of the [**IVssWriterComponents**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsswritercomponents?branch=master) interface, which allows direct access through the [**IVssComponent**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent?branch=master) interface to those of its components [*explicitly included*](vssgloss-e.md#base-vssgloss-explicit-component-inclusion) in the requester's Backup Components Document. The writer used the instances of the **IVssComponent** interface that define component sets to gain access to its *implicitly included* component (see [Selectability and working with Component Properties](selectability-and-working-with-component-properties.md)).

During the handling of the [**PrepareForBackup**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup?branch=master) event, writers use the [**IVssComponent**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent?branch=master) interface to perform component-by-component (or component set by component set) operations, including:

1.  Adding [*partial files*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-partial-file-support) (if supported) by calling [**IVssComponent::AddPartialFile**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-addpartialfile?branch=master).
2.  Setting any private metadata that the writer will need to handle the restore.
3.  If the writer supports incremental and differential backups (see [Incremental and Differential Backups](incremental-and-differential-backups.md)), doing the following:
    -   Checking for previous backup time stamps by calling [**IVssComponent::GetPreviousBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getpreviousbackupstamp?branch=master).
    -   Adding any required [*differenced files*](vssgloss-d.md#base-vssgloss-differenced-files) by calling [**IVssComponent::AddDifferencedFilesByLastModifyTime**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-adddifferencedfilesbylastmodifytime?branch=master).
    -   If the writer supports the **VSS\_BS\_TIMESTAMPED** schema, adding backup time-stamp strings in the writer's own format using [**IVssComponent::SetBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-setbackupstamp?branch=master).
4.  Initiating very time-consuming asynchronous operations, such as synchronizing data across multiple disks. This will allow the writer to continue working while the operation is processed, including handling other VSS events. These operations must terminate before the [*Freeze*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-freeze-event) event.

The requester's call to [**IVssBackupComponents::DoSnapshotSet**](/windows/win32/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-dosnapshotset?branch=master) initiates the shadow copy and generates the following events for the writers to handle:

-   [*PrepareForSnapshot*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-preparesnapshot-event)
-   [*Freeze*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-freeze-event)
-   [*Thaw*](vssgloss-t.md#base-vssgloss-thaw-event)
-   [*PostSnapshot*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-postsnapshot-event)

Three of the writer's handlers—[**CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparesnapshot?branch=master), [**CVssWriter::OnFreeze**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onfreeze?branch=master), and [**CVssWriter::OnThaw**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onthaw?branch=master)—are pure virtual methods, and each writer must implement them rather than relying on defaults. Depending on a writer's needs, they may be coded as dummy methods, simply returning **TRUE**.

Because there is typically a narrow time window between the issuing of a [*Freeze*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-freeze-event) event and the issuing of a [*Thaw*](vssgloss-t.md#base-vssgloss-thaw-event) event, most of the major work in preparing for the shadow copy—such as shutting down processes, creating temporary files, or draining I/O queues—would be handled in [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparesnapshot?branch=master).

How a writer might use [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparesnapshot?branch=master) to handle its I/O before the creation of a shadow copy is highly dependent on the writer's own architecture.

Writers that can afford to hold all writes and keep the data in an absolute consistent state before [*Freeze*](vssgloss-f.md#base-vssgloss-freeze-event), should do so.

If the writer cannot freeze its I/O, then it should take actions to create a stable source for backup and to reduce the recovery time for a shadow copy. Examples of this might include queuing incoming I/O requests or generating a duplicate set of files in an [*alternate path*](vssgloss-a.md#base-vssgloss-alternate-path) to be used as the source of a backup.

The [**CVssWriter::OnFreeze**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onfreeze?branch=master) method performs simple, short tasks such as verifying that the [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparesnapshot?branch=master) left I/O in the correct state, and that any asynchronous tasks started by [**CVssWriter::OnPrepareBackup**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparebackup?branch=master) completed. This method is a writer's last chance to veto a shadow copy if there are problems (see [Writer Errors and Vetoes](writer-errors-and-vetoes.md)).

It is generally possible for a writer to resume normal operation following a [*Thaw*](vssgloss-t.md#base-vssgloss-thaw-event) event: a shadow copy may not be immediately ready for backup after the Thaw, but a writer should be able to resume normal operation. Therefore, typically [**CVssWriter::OnThaw**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onthaw?branch=master) is used by writers to return to a pre-freeze state. However, any temporary files created to support the shadow copy should be left in place until the [*PostSnapshot*](vssgloss-p.md#base-vssgloss-postsnapshot-event) event. Typically, you would use [**CVssWriter::OnPostSnapshot**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpostsnapshot?branch=master) for this sort of cleanup. Because many applications do not require this sort of cleanup, **CVssWriter::OnPostSnapshot** is a virtual method with a default implementation that simply returns **TRUE**. If an incremental or differential backup is being performed, the writer may call [**IVssComponent::GetPreviousBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getpreviousbackupstamp?branch=master) and [**IVssComponent::SetBackupStamp**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-setbackupstamp?branch=master).

Another method that can be called at this time is [**IVssComponent::AddDifferencedFilesByLastModifyTime**](/windows/win32/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-adddifferencedfilesbylastmodifytime?branch=master).
