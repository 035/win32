# Multilingual User Interface

Multilingual User Interface (MUI) enables the localization of user interfaces for globalized applications. MUI also supports the creation of resources for any number of user interface languages.

This documentation describes MUI and tells you how to add MUI functionality to your fully globalized application. However, it does not attempt to describe all the details of globalized application development on Windows. For details of this type, see the Microsoft [Go Global Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/goglobal).

The MUI documentation includes the following sections:

-   [About Multilingual User Interface](about-multilingual-user-interface.md)
-   [Using Multilingual User Interface](using-multilingual-user-interface.md)
-   [Multilingual User Interface Reference](multilingual-user-interface-reference.md)
