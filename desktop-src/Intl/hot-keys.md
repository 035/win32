# Hot Keys

Hot keys give the user a way to quickly change the input mode of an IME or to switch to another IME. Although applications cannot add hot keys to the operating system, they can initiate the same action as a hot key by using the [**ImmSimulateHotKey**](immsimulatehotkey.md) function.

The HexToUnicode IME also permits conversion between hexadecimal and Unicode characters. For more information, see [HexToUnicode IME](hextounicode-ime.md).
