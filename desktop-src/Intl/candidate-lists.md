# Candidate Lists

A candidate list is represented by a [**CANDIDATELIST**](candidatelist.md) structure containing an array of strings specifying the characters or character strings from which the user can choose. Your IME-aware application can retrieve candidate list information using the [**ImmGetCandidateListCount**](immgetcandidatelistcount.md) and [**ImmGetCandidateList**](immgetcandidatelist.md) functions.
