# Candidate Lists

A candidate list is represented by a [**CANDIDATELIST**](/windows/win32/Imm/ns-imm-tagcandidatelist?branch=master) structure containing an array of strings specifying the characters or character strings from which the user can choose. Your IME-aware application can retrieve candidate list information using the [**ImmGetCandidateListCount**](/windows/win32/Imm/nf-imm-immgetcandidatelistcounta?branch=master) and [**ImmGetCandidateList**](/windows/win32/Imm/nf-imm-immgetcandidatelista?branch=master) functions.
