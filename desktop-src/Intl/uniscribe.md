# Uniscribe

Uniscribe is a set of APIs that allow a high degree of control for fine typography and for processing complex scripts. Both complex scripts and simple scripts with fine typography effects require special processing to display and edit because the characters ("glyphs") are not laid out in a simple way. For complex scripts, the rules governing the shaping and positioning of glyphs are specified and catalogued in [The Unicode Standard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=161643).

This topic discusses various aspects of fine typography and the processing of complex scripts, and is presented as follows:
