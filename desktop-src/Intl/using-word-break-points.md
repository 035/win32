# Using Word Break Points

When the application is dealing with whole words, valid positions for the caret are marked by the value of the **fWordStop** member of the [**SCRIPT\_LOGATTR**](script-logattr.md) structure. This value is retrieved by making a call to [**ScriptBreak**](scriptbreak.md).

Valid positions for breaking lines between words are marked by the **fSoftBreak** value retrieved by [**ScriptBreak**](scriptbreak.md).
