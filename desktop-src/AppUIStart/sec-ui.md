# Security Considerations: Windows User Interface

This topic provides information about security considerations in the Windows User Interface. This topic doesn't provide all you need to know about security issues. Instead, use it as a starting point and reference for this technology area.

With the increase in computer interconnectivity, developers now must concern themselves with application security. However, security also enhances general application safety and robustness; therefore it is another way that the developer can provide a good user experience. The following topics discuss some potential security concerns when using the Windows User Interface.

-   [String Considerations](#string-considerations)
-   [User Input](#user-input)
-   [Security Alerts](#security-alerts)
-   [Related topics](#related-topics)

## String Considerations

Many functions, messages, and macros use strings in their parameters. However, often the strings are not checked for null-termination or for length. A related concern is miscalculating the length of a string or buffer. In either case, this can lead to buffer overflow or data truncation, which can affect your application adversely. For more information about buffer overruns and other security concerns, see *Writing Secure Code* by Michael Howard and David Leblanc, Microsoft Press, 2002.

To handle strings in a safe manner, you should do the following:

-   Check strings for null-termination or for the proper length, as appropriate.
-   Take special care to determine the length of a string or buffer, especially when it contains **TCHAR** values.
-   If you create a string or use a string that was used previously, initialize it to zero or insert a null-terminator, as appropriate.

In addition, consider using the [StrSafe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647466) functions when dealing with strings. These functions are designed to handle strings safely.

## User Input

The Windows user interface is concerned with getting and responding to information from users. However, users who enter incorrect data can disrupt your application, whether or not they intend to do so. Thus, the cardinal rule is that all input must be validated.

Of primary concern is string data, which is discussed in [String Considerations](#string-considerations). However, all types of input should be validated before being used by your application. Another concern is when data is validated at one point but changes before it is used, for example, when receiving messages that give the length of text. So, if there is a chance the data might change, you should check the data just before you use it

## Security Alerts

The following table lists features that, if used incorrectly, can compromise the security of your applications.
