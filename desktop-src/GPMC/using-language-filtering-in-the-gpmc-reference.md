# Using Language Filtering in the GPMC Reference

You can use language filtering to selectively display the information that is relevant to your programming environment.

To use language filtering, click the **Language Filter** button in the upper-left portion of the title bar in reference section topics. On the **Language** menu, you can choose to view documentation that is relevant to C/C++, Microsoft JScript, or Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript). If you select **Show All**, the documentation is displayed for all the programming environments. Regardless of the language selection, information in the topic that pertains to all environments is always displayed. For example, the general concepts and descriptions are always displayed.

After you select a language-filtering option, the selection remains in effect until you select a new filtering option.
