# GPMC Features and Functionality

The Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) has programmatic interfaces for the following features:

-   Backing up, restoring, importing, and copying Group Policy objects (GPOs).
-   Creating, deleting, and renaming GPOs and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) filters.
-   Linking GPOs and WMI filters.
-   Searching for GPOs.
-   Delegating Group Policy-related features including permissions on GPOs and WMI filters, policy-related permissions on SOMs (sites, domains, and OUs), and creation rights for GPOs and WMI filters.
-   Reporting GPO settings.
-   Reporting Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) data.
-   Creating and modifying migration tables.
-   Creating RSoP queries.

For more information about backup, restore, import, and copy operations, see [GPO Operations Supported by the GPMC](gpo-operations-supported-by-the-gpmc.md).
