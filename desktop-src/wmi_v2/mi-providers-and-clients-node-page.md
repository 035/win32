# MI Providers and Clients

This section includes several examples that illustrate how to build, register, and test an Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) provider as well as how to consume an MI provider from either a native or managed MI client. Be sure to check out the [How to: Configure the MI Development Environment](how-to--configure-the-mi-development-environment.md) so that you have all the necessary bits downloaded and installed when you begin your development.

A Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) provider enables you to define management data and operations that can be performed on that data. For example, you can develop providers for anything that requires some sort of management at the network or enterprise level. This includes hardware such as hard drives, network connections, and printers as well as software settings such as services, drivers, and so forth. Each of this section's topics presents a set of step-by-step instructions that illustrate tasks such as how to build, register, and test an MI Provider using MI tools, Microsoft Visual Studio, and PowerShell.
