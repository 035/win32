# How to Implement a Managed MI Client

A Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) client enables you to consume data exposed by an MI provider. This section presents a set of step-by-step instructions that illustrate how to perform various tasks from a managed MI client using the [MI .NET API](Http://Go.Microsoft.Com/FWLink/p/?LinkID=308910) and Microsoft Visual C#.

> [!Note]  
> To see examples of implementing an MI client using the [MI API](Http://Go.Microsoft.Com/FWLink/p/?LinkID=308914) and Microsoft Visual C++, refer to [How to Implement a Native MI Client](how-to-implement-a-native-mi-client.md).
