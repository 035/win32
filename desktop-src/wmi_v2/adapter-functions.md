## In this section

<dl> <dt>

[**Adapter\_DllCanUnloadNow**](adapter-dllcanunloadnow.md)
</dt> <dd>

Exposes the [**DllCanUnloadNow**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms690368) function to a provider. This function allows a provider to call the adapter function **DllCanUnloadNow**, which determines whether the DLL that implements this function is in use.

</dd> <dt>

[**Adapter\_DllGetClassObject**](adapter-dllgetclassobject.md)
</dt> <dd>

Retrieves an interface pointer that a provider can use to communicate with the specified class object. The interface exposes the [**DllGetClassObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680760) function to the provider. The [**CoGetClassObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684007) function locates, and if necessary, dynamically loads the executable code that is required by this operation.

</dd> <dt>

[**Adapter\_RegisterDLL**](adapter-registerdll.md)
</dt> <dd>

Registers a provider DLL when Mofcomp.exe or Register-CimProvider.exe are used to register the provider with the WMI infrastructure.

</dd> <dt>

[**Adapter\_UnRegisterDLL**](adapter-unregisterdll.md)
</dt> <dd>

Removes the registration of the provider DLL when Mofcomp.exe or Register-CimProvider.exe are used to register the provider with the WMI infrastructure.

</dd> </dl>
