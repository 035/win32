# Using DSML Services for Windows

DSML Services for Windows is the Microsoft implementation of DSML V2. The topics in this section describe how the elements of an XML document can be used to store data in and get data from a system directory.

DSML Services for Windows uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTP through a webpage to receive and send DSML V2 messages to and from a client. For more information and an example of how to send a SOAP message that contains a DSML payload over HTTP, see [Transmitting and Receiving SOAP-DSML Messages](tranrecsoapdsmlmess.md).

The following topics provide examples of how to construct SOAP messages that contain DSML payloads to perform common directory operations:

-   [Performing Basic Operations](basoper.md)
-   [Performing Advanced Operations](advoper.md)

For information on running DSML Services for Windows in a production environment, see [Running DSML Services for Windows in a Production Environment](running-dsml-for-windows-in-a-typical-production-environment.md).

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting DSML Services for Windows](troudsmlservwind.md).
