</dt> <dd>

An open community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet. Technical work is performed by working groups organized by topic areas (such as routing, transport, and security) and through mailing lists. Internet standards are developed in IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs), which are a series of notes that discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication, focusing on networking protocols, programs, and concepts.

</dt> <dd>

The primary access protocol for Active Directory. LDAP is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), that allows users to query and update information in a directory service. Active Directory supports both LDAP version 2 and LDAP version 3.

<span id="Simple_Object_Access_Protocol"></span><span id="simple_object_access_protocol"></span><span id="SIMPLE_OBJECT_ACCESS_PROTOCOL"></span>**Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**
</dt> <dd>

An XML/HTTP-based protocol for platform-independent access to objects and services on the web. SOAP defines a message format in XML that travels over the Internet using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). By using existing web protocols (HTTP) and languages (XML), SOAP runs over the existing Internet infrastructure without being tied to any operating system, language, or object model.

</dt> <dd>

An information management standard adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in 1986 as a means of providing platform- and application-independent documents that retain formatting, indexing, and linked information. SGML provides a grammar-like mechanism for users to define the structure of their documents and the tags they will use to denote the structure in their individual documents.
