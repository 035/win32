# DSML Services for Windows Reference

Because of the evolving nature of DSML, it is recommended that you refer to the OASIS specifications and schemas for reference information. The OASIS website will provide you with the most current information about DSML. There are two other important documents:

-   DSML V2 Specification

    Go to [http://www.oasis-open.org](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84150) and, under the **Technical Committees** heading, click **Directory Services**. The resultant webpage contains a link to the DSML V2 specification.

-   DSML Version 2.0 XML Schema

    Go to [http://www.oasis-open.org](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84150) and, under the **Technical Committees** heading, click **Directory Services**. The resultant webpage contains a link to the DSML V2 XML schema.

Because SOAP is an external standard, it is recommended that you refer to the W3C specifications for reference information. For information about the SOAP V1.1 specification, see [http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84162).
