# DSML Services for Windows Standard Binding Methods

DSML V2 is defined in terms of a set of XML fragments that are used as payloads in a particular type of binding. A binding defines how the DSML V2 XML fragments are sent as requests and responses in the context of a specific transport such as SOAP, SMTP, or a simple data file.

The current implementation of DSML Services for Windows uses [SOAP request and response binding](soap-request-and-response-binding.md).
