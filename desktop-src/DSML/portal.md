# DSML Services for Windows

## Purpose

Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) Services for Windows is the Microsoft implementation of the DSML Version 2 (V2) standard established by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).

DSML Version 1 enables you to represent directory data as an XML document.

DSML V2 extends this functionality by providing a method for expressing directory queries and updates, and the results of these operations, as XML documents.

## Run-time requirements

DSML Services for Windows supports the following operating system platforms: The DSML Server is only supported on Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. However, the DSML Client, which is available on the .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5, is supported on the same platforms on which the .NET Framework is supported.
