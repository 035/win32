# Video Capture Minidrivers

## 

This section contains the reference pages for video capture minidrivers that conform to the Windows Driver Model (WDM). It discusses the following topics:

<dl>

[Video Capture Minidriver Property Sets](stream.video_capture_minidriver_property_sets)  
[Video Capture Minidriver Enumerations and Structures](video-capture-minidriver-enumerations-and-structures.md)  
[Video Capture Minidriver Event Sets](stream.video_capture_minidriver_event_sets)  
</dl>

**Note:** If you are writing a new streaming minidriver for Windows Vista, please use AVStream rather than the Stream Class. However, both AVStream and Stream Class streaming minidrivers access the same kernel streaming properties, events and structures in this documentation.
