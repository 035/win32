# Kernel-Mode Driver Reference

## 

This section contains reference material that includes specific details about the routines, structures, and data types that you will need to use to write kernel-mode drivers. This section is divided into three parts:

-   [Standard Driver Routines](standard-driver-routines.md) provide reference information on routines you implement in your driver.

-   [Driver Support Routines](driver-support-routines.md) provide reference information on routines your driver can call to interface with Windows. These routines are sorted by component.

-   [Kernel Data Types](kernel-data-types.md) provides a detailed reference to the data types and structures that Windows uses.

> [!Note]  
> For information on the architecture, concepts, and programming techniques that are important for understanding the topics in this reference, see the [Kernel-Mode Driver Architecture Design Guide](kernel.kernel_mode_driver_architecture_design_guide).
