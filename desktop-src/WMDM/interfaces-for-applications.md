# Interfaces for Applications

This section describes interfaces used or implemented by applications using the Windows Media Device Manager SDK to communicate with devices. The term "application" used here means any executable, plug-in, or COM object that exists on a desktop computer and needs high-level communication with a connected portable device. This can include a media player application, a Windows Media Player plug-in (if it needs direct access to a portable device), or a play-count metering COM object.

Some of these interfaces are implemented by the application, while others are called by the application. The documentation for each interface indicates whether it is implemented or called (and if implemented, whether it is optional or required).

The following interfaces or classes are used by applications.



| Interface or class                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Callback Interfaces

The following optional interfaces are implemented by an application in order to track the progress of an asynchronous request, such as a read or write request.



| Interface                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**IWMDMNotification**](/windows/win32/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmnotification?branch=master) | Allows applications and service providers to receive notifications when devices or memory storages (such as RAM cards) are connected or disconnected from the computer. |
| [**IWMDMOperation2**](/windows/win32/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmoperation2?branch=master)     | Extends **IWMDMOperation** by providing methods to get and set extended attributes.                                                                                     |

The following diagram shows how most of the important application interfaces are acquired from the root **IWMDeviceManager** interface. An application gets this root interface by cocreating the MediaDevMgr object, requesting the **IComponentAuthenticate** interface, authenticating the component, and then requesting the **IWMDeviceManager** (these steps are described in [Authenticating the Application](authenticating-the-application.md)). Once this root interface has been acquired, [**IWMDeviceManager::EnumDevices**](/windows/win32/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iwmdevicemanager-enumdevices?branch=master) is called to create an object that implements [**IWMDMEnumDevice**](/windows/win32/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmenumdevice?branch=master). Other interfaces are obtained by calling methods on interfaces in the order shown. Derived interfaces such as [**IWMDMDevice2**](/windows/win32/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmdevice2?branch=master) are obtained by calling **QueryInterface** on the base interface.

In the following diagram, derived interfaces are labeled by slash marks, so "IWMDMStorage/2/3" would indicate **IWMDMStorage**, **IWMDMStorage2**, and **IWMDMStorage3**.
