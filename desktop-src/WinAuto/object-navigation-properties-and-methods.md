# Object Navigation Properties and Methods

Clients *navigate* from one object to another using methods such as [**IAccessible::accNavigate**](iaccessible-iaccessible--accnavigate.md) and [**IAccessible::accHitTest**](iaccessible-iaccessible--acchittest.md). These methods allow clients to retrieve either a child ID or the address of another object's [**IAccessible**](iaccessible.md) interface. Navigation allows clients to explore how objects are related to each other. Note that navigating to another object does not change the selection or focus.

The [**IAccessible**](iaccessible.md) interface provides properties and methods that support the following kinds of navigation:

-   [Hierarchical Navigation](hierarchical-navigation.md)
-   [Spatial and Logical Navigation](spatial-and-logical-navigation.md)
-   [Navigation Through Hit Testing and Screen Location](navigation-through-hit-testing-and-screen-location.md)
