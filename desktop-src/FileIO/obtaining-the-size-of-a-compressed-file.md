# Obtaining the Size of a Compressed File

Use the [**GetCompressedFileSize**](/windows/win32/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getcompressedfilesizea?branch=master) function to obtain the compressed size of a file. If the file is compressed, its compressed size will be less than its uncompressed size. Use the [**GetFileSize**](/windows/win32/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-getfilesize?branch=master) function to determine the uncompressed size of a file.
