# Obtaining the Size of a Compressed File

Use the [**GetCompressedFileSize**](getcompressedfilesize.md) function to obtain the compressed size of a file. If the file is compressed, its compressed size will be less than its uncompressed size. Use the [**GetFileSize**](getfilesize.md) function to determine the uncompressed size of a file.
