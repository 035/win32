| Enhanced Taskbar<br/>                            | The taskbar has been extended significantly under the guiding principle of getting users where they're going as quickly and efficiently as possible. To that end, the application windows, files, and commands that the user needs to accomplish that are now centralized into a single taskbar button that consolidates previously scattered information sources and controls. A user can now find common tasks, recent and frequent files, alerts, progress notifications, and thumbnails for individual documents or tabs all in one place. <br/> For more information, see [Taskbar Extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd378460).<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Packaging<br/>                                   | A package is a compressed file that contains application data. The Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) introduce two basic concepts to describe a package: parts and relationships. A part is a physical object that contains application data and is located inside a package. A relationship is a logical association between any package or part and a URI-addressable resource such as a part or an external Web site.<br/> A digital signature is used to validate the package originator's identity and to confirm that the signed contents of the package have not been modified after signing. In a package, the signature can reference the package components that have been signed; it can include objects that contain application data, which may also have been signed; and it can include certificates, which can be used in signature validation.<br/> For more information, see [Packaging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd371623).<br/> |
