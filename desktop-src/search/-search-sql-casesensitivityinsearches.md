# Case Sensitivity in Searches

Microsoft Windows Search queries are not case-sensitive. This includes query keywords (SELECT is identical to Select, select, and sELect) and search terms. If an identifier or literal uses Unicode characters that have case-mapping semantics, the search engine considers all the cases equivalent.
