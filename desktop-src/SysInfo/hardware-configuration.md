# Hardware Configuration

The hardware configuration functions retrieve information such as processor, hardware profile, and keyboard information.

The [**GetSystemInfo**](getsysteminfo.md) function retrieves processor and memory information, such as the page size, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) identifier, number and type of processors, application address range, and so on. The [**IsProcessorFeaturePresent**](isprocessorfeaturepresent.md) function retrieves information about the floating-point operations and instruction sets supported by the processor.

The [**GetCurrentHwProfile**](getcurrenthwprofile.md) function retrieves information about the hardware profile. The hardware profile includes information such as the docking state, globally unique identifier (GUID), and display name for the profile. The [**GetKeyboardType**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724336) function retrieves such information as the type of keyboard and the number of function keys on the current keyboard.
