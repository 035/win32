# Enumerations

Enumerations in Structured Storage are data types that consist of a sequence of named values in a given order. An enumerated data type allows a member of a class of objects to be described in natural language. Enumerations are most useful in the context where all possible values of a variable are known and the expression of that variable in the programming language can therefore be expressed in natural-language words.

The Structured Storage enumerations are described in the following sections.

-   [**LOCKTYPE**](locktype.md)
-   [**STATFLAG**](statflag.md)
-   [**STGC**](stgc.md)
-   [**STGFMT**](stgfmt.md)
-   [**STGMOVE**](stgmove.md)
-   [**STGTY**](stgty.md)
-   [**STREAM\_SEEK**](stream-seek.md)
