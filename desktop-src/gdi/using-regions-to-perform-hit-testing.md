# Using Regions to Perform Hit Testing

The example in [Brushes](brushes.md) uses regions to simulate a "zoomed" view of an 8- by 8-pixel monochrome bitmap. By clicking on the pixels in this bitmap, the user creates a custom brush suitable for drawing operations. The example shows how to use the [**PtInRegion**](ptinregion.md) function to perform hit testing and the [**InvertRgn**](invertrgn.md) function to invert the colors in a region.
