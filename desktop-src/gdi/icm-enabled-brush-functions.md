# ICM-Enabled Brush Functions

Microsoft Image Color Management (ICM) ensures that a color image, graphic, or text object is rendered as close as possible to its original intent on any device, despite differences in imaging technologies and color capabilities between devices. Whether you are scanning an image or other graphic on a color scanner, downloading it over the Internet, viewing or editing it on the screen, or outputting it to paper, film, or other media, ICM 2.0 helps you keep its colors consistent and accurate. For more information about ICM, see [Windows Color System](wcs.windows_color_system).

The following brush functions are enabled for use with ICM:

-   [**CreateBrushIndirect**](createbrushindirect.md)
-   [**CreateDIBPatternBrush**](createdibpatternbrush.md)
-   [**CreateDIBPatternBrushPt**](createdibpatternbrushpt.md)
-   [**CreateHatchBrush**](createhatchbrush.md)
-   [**CreatePatternBrush**](createpatternbrush.md)
-   [**CreateSolidBrush**](createsolidbrush.md)
