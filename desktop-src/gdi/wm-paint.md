# WM\_PAINT message

The **WM\_PAINT** message is sent when the system or another application makes a request to paint a portion of an application's window. The message is sent when the [**UpdateWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-updatewindow) or [**RedrawWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-redrawwindow) function is called, or by the [**DispatchMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**DispatchMessage**) function when the application obtains a **WM\_PAINT** message by using the [**GetMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**GetMessage**) or [**PeekMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**PeekMessage**) function.

A window receives this message through its [**WindowProc**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**WindowProc**) function.


```C++
LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(
  HWND hwnd, 
  UINT  uMsg, 
  WPARAM wParam, 
  LPARAM lParam     
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*wParam* 
</dt> <dd>

This parameter is not used.

</dd> <dt>

*lParam* 
</dt> <dd>

This parameter is not used.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

An application returns zero if it processes this message.

## Remarks

The **WM\_PAINT** message is generated by the system and should not be sent by an application. To force a window to draw into a specific device context, use the [**WM\_PRINT**](wm-print.md) or [**WM\_PRINTCLIENT**](wm-printclient.md) message. Note that this requires the target window to support the **WM\_PRINTCLIENT** message. Most common controls support the **WM\_PRINTCLIENT** message.

The [**DefWindowProc**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**DefWindowProc**) function validates the update region. The function may also send the [**WM\_NCPAINT**](wm-ncpaint.md) message to the window procedure if the window frame must be painted and send the [**WM\_ERASEBKGND**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**WM\_ERASEBKGND**) message if the window background must be erased.

The system sends this message when there are no other messages in the application's message queue. [**DispatchMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**DispatchMessage**) determines where to send the message; [**GetMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**GetMessage**) determines which message to dispatch. **GetMessage** returns the **WM\_PAINT** message when there are no other messages in the application's message queue, and **DispatchMessage** sends the message to the appropriate window procedure.

A window may receive internal paint messages as a result of calling [**RedrawWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-redrawwindow) with the RDW\_INTERNALPAINT flag set. In this case, the window may not have an update region. An application may call the [**GetUpdateRect**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-getupdaterect) function to determine whether the window has an update region. If **GetUpdateRect** returns zero, the application need not call the [**BeginPaint**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-beginpaint) and [**EndPaint**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-endpaint) functions.

An application must check for any necessary internal painting by looking at its internal data structures for each **WM\_PAINT** message, because a **WM\_PAINT** message may have been caused by both a non-NULL update region and a call to [**RedrawWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-redrawwindow) with the RDW\_INTERNALPAINT flag set.

The system sends an internal **WM\_PAINT** message only once. After an internal **WM\_PAINT** message is returned from [**GetMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**GetMessage**) or [**PeekMessage**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**PeekMessage**) or is sent to a window by [**UpdateWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-updatewindow), the system does not post or send further **WM\_PAINT** messages until the window is invalidated or until [**RedrawWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-redrawwindow) is called again with the RDW\_INTERNALPAINT flag set.

For some common controls, the default **WM\_PAINT** message processing checks the *wParam* parameter. If *wParam* is non-NULL, the control assumes that the value is an HDC and paints using that device context.
