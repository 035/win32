# Inverting Regions

An application inverts the colors that appear within a region by calling the [**InvertRgn**](invertrgn.md) function. On monochrome displays, **InvertRgn** makes white pixels black and black pixels white. On color screens, this inversion is dependent on the type of technology used to generate the colors for the screen.
