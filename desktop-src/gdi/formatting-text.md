# Formatting Text

The formatting functions can be divided into three categories: those that retrieve or set the [text-formatting attributes](text-formatting-attributes.md) for a device context, those that retrieve [character widths](character-widths.md), and those that retrieve [string widths and heights](string-widths-and-heights.md).
