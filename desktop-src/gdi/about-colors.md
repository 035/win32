# About Colors

Color can be used to communicate ideas, show relationships between items, and improve the appeal and quality of output. Windows enables applications to discover the color capabilities of given devices and to choose from the available colors those that best suit their needs.

This overview provides information on the following topics:

-   [Color Basics](color-basics.md)
-   [Color Palettes](color-palettes.md)

Although not described in this overview, image color matching is an important feature of color management that helps ensure that color images look the same whether displayed on screen or printed on paper. For more information, see [Windows Color System](https://msdn.microsoft.com/b354b90f-575d-4392-9aa2-6fb1d2cb3c07).
