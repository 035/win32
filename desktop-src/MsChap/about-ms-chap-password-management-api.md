# About MS-CHAP Password Management

The MS-CHAP Password Management API provides password authentication capabilities for remote workstations that reside on Windows networks. This small API is used in the development of user authentication applications to support the Microsoft dialect of PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol. The Microsoft dialect is called Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP).

MS-CHAP closely follows the standard for PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol as described in [RFC 1994](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=111238). The Microsoft modifications to the standard extend the authentication capabilities that local users receive on Windows-based LANs to remote workstations.

For further information on MS-CHAP, see the RFC document at [RFC 2433](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84041)
