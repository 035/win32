# MS-CHAP Password Management API

## Purpose

The MS-CHAP Password Management API makes it possible to use MS-CHAP to change user passwords. Windows programmers can use this API to create applications to change the passwords of networked users on remote workstations.

## Where applicable

The MS-CHAP Password Management API is intended for use with Windows Remote Access Service (RAS) servers running MS-CHAP in conformance with [RFC 2433](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84041) sections 9 and 10.

## Developer audience

The MS-CHAP Password Management API was created for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with Windows network programming and RAS is assumed.

## Run-time requirements

The MS-CHAP Password Management API requires a server running Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular programming element, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.
