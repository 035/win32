# Subauthentication Packages

The [*authentication packages*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*authentication packages*) provided with Windows support customization using [*subauthentication packages*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*subauthentication packages*). A subauthentication package is a DLL that supplements or replaces part of the authentication and validation criteria used by the main authentication package. For example, a particular server might supply a subauthentication package that validates a user's password with a different algorithm or specifies workstation restrictions in a different format.

For more information about subauthentication packages, see the SubAuth sample installed with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).
