# Subauthentication Packages

The [*authentication packages*](security.a_gly#-security-authentication-package-gly) provided with Windows support customization using [*subauthentication packages*](security.s_gly#-security-subauthentication-package-gly). A subauthentication package is a DLL that supplements or replaces part of the authentication and validation criteria used by the main authentication package. For example, a particular server might supply a subauthentication package that validates a user's password with a different algorithm or specifies workstation restrictions in a different format.

For more information about subauthentication packages, see the SubAuth sample installed with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).
