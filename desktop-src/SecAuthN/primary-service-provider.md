# Primary Service Provider

Each [*smart card*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*smart card*) known to the system may have a registered COM interface listed as its primary service provider. When you access a *smart card* through COM, this [*primary service provider*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*primary service provider*) supplies the control interfaces to the card. This allows card services to be exposed to a wide range of programming environments, including Java and the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.
