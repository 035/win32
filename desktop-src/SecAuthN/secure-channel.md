# Secure Channel

Secure Channel, also known as [*Schannel*](security.s_gly#-security-schannel-gly), is a [*security support provider*](security.s_gly#-security-security-support-provider-gly) (SSP) that contains a set of security protocols that provide identity authentication and secure, private communication through encryption.

Schannel is primarily used for Internet applications that require secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) communications.
