# Using Message Support

After a handshake has been completed and a secure connection has been established, an application can use the [**MakeSignature**](makesignature.md), [**EncryptMessage (General)**](encryptmessage--general-.md), [**VerifySignature**](verifysignature.md), and [**DecryptMessage (General)**](decryptmessage--general-.md) functions to exchange signed or encrypted application data with the remote computer.

Examples that use these functions after a [*security context*](security.s_gly#-security-security-context-gly) has been established are demonstrated in the following sections:

-   [Signing a Message](signing-a-message.md)
-   [Verifying a Message](verifying-a-message.md)
-   [Encrypting a Message](encrypting-a-message.md)
-   [Decrypting a Message](decrypting-a-message.md)
