# QOS API

The QOS API is the programmatic interface to the RSVP SP. Under most circumstances, the QOS API is the only interface that programmers will require to create QOS-aware or QOS-enabled applications. Most operations that happen on behalf of an application in the QOS sequence are a result of QOS API calls communicating requests down (and sometimes back up) through QOS components, creating a QOS-enabled flow of data that keeps important data moving through the network with preferential transmission consideration.

For more information on the programming elements included in the QOS API, see [QOS Reference](qos-reference.md).
