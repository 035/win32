# Mapping QOS Call Sequences to RSVP

RSVP signaling is invoked once a series of QOS calls (the collection of which initiate QOS activity) is completed. Such call sequences tend to differ based on whether an application is a sender or receiver, and for that reason, senders and receivers are discussed separately.

Often, applications will be both sender and receiver, in which case both sender and receiver call sequences may apply.
