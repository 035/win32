# RSVP Service

The RSVP service is a single instance Windows 2000 service that runs on a Windows 2000 computer. The RSVP service instigates traffic control functionality (if appropriate), and implements, maintains, and handles RSVP signaling for all Windows 2000 QOS functionality.

The RSVP service, by virtue of the fact that it implements and maintains RSVP and is the initiator of traffic control, is at the heart of Windows 2000 Quality of Service.

> [!Note]  
> RSVP signaling is not supported on Windows XP or later versions of Windows.
