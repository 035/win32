# BEST EFFORT

The BEST EFFORT service type instructs the RSVP SP to use the application's QOS parameters as guidelines for service quality requests, and make reasonable effort to maintain the requested level of service. The BEST EFFORT service type does not make any guarantees that requested QOS parameters will be implemented or enforced, but can be used by senders to specify traffic control objects.

 

> [!Note]  
> RSVP signaling is not supported on Windows XP or later versions of Windows.
