# QOS Components

The QOS documentation divides QOS components into the following three categories:

-   [Application-Driven QOS Components](application-driven-qos-components.md)
-   [Network-Driven QOS Components](network-driven-qos-components.md)
-   [Policy-Driven QOS Components](policy-driven-qos-components.md)

> [!Note]  
> This arrangement is for convenience and clarity. Though individual components among the three categories can function independently to provide certain subsets of QOS functionality, overall, Windows 2000 QOS is an integrated technology.

 

This is the approach taken with all QOS components, with one exception: RSVP. Though the bulk of RSVP will be discussed within the Application-Driven QOS Components topic, elements that have effects elsewhere (namely in the network, and for facilitation of policy checking) will be included in their respective sections.
