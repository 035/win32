# About qWAVE

qWAVE provides the functionality for socket-based applications to gather in-depth, real-time information of a variable bandwidth network allowing it to dynamically adapt to changing network conditions. It also allows applications to prioritize packets in order to make better use of the available bandwidth.

The functionality provided by the qWAVE API is mainly targeted for use by multimedia applications that require network QOS for streams on a home network.

A PC or device must implement the Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) Responder protocol with QOS extensions for qWAVE in order to expose advanced functionality, such as bandwidth measurements and congestion notifications. Windows Vista supports LLTD by default.

For more information about devices that support LLTD, see [Link Layer Topology Discovery protocol (LLTD)](link-layer-topology-discovery-protocol.md) .
