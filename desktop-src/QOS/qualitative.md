# QUALITATIVE

The QUALITATIVE service type is suited for applications that require better than BEST EFFORT service, but are unable to quantify their requirements. Applications that request QUALITATIVE service can supply an application ID policy object. Policy servers on the network use information in the application ID object to identify the application's flow and assign it an appropriate quality of service. For more information on how to insert an application ID, see the Microsoft white paper Inserting Application and Sub-application IDs or the IETF Internet Draft on APP ID, draft-ietf-rap-rsvp-appid-00.txt.

> [!Note]  
> RSVP signaling is not supported on Windows XP or later versions of Windows.
