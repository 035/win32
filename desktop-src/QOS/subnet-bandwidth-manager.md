# Subnet Bandwidth Manager

The Subnet Bandwidth Manager (SBM) is the QOS component that provides resource management and policy based–admission control for QOS-aware applications using shared media subnets (Ethernet, for example). The SBM is based on an IETF draft that defines SBM functionality and its general implementation.

SBM is implemented in Windows 2000 through the [Admission Control Service](admission-control-service.md) (ACS). ACS is a Windows 2000 service that resides on a Windows 2000 Server.
