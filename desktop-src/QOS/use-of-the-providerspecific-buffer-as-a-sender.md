# Use of the ProviderSpecific Buffer as a Sender

Senders can use the ProviderSpecific buffer to do the following:

While making QOS requests, senders can:

-   Specify one or more policy elements (policy information) to RSVP.
-   Specify traffic control parameters such as shape/discard mode.
-   Specify policy information.

While receiving notification, such as getting additional information from the sender, senders can:

-   Retrieve QOS events.
-   Retrieve policy information.
