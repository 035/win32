# Traffic Control Modules

Traffic control (TC) plays a central role in the provision of quality of service. With traffic control, packets are prioritized both inside and outside the node on which TC is used. The implications for such granular control (or preferential treatment) of packets as they flow through the system and through the network, reach across the entire network realm or enterprise. Traffic control is realized through two modules, the [Generic Packet Classifier](generic-packet-classifier.md) and the [Packet Scheduler](packet-scheduler.md).
