# Network-Driven QOS Components

<dl> <dt>

<span id="802.1p"></span><span id="802.1P"></span>[802.1p](802-1p.md)
</dt> <dd>

The use of flags in the media access control (MAC) header to establish packet priority in shared-media 802 networks.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Differentiated_Services"></span><span id="differentiated_services"></span><span id="DIFFERENTIATED_SERVICES"></span>[Differentiated Services](differentiated-services.md)
</dt> <dd>

Enables the marking of relative priority for IP packets. Differentiated Services enable the marking of packets with a code point value, called the DiffServe code point, which is used by network devices such as routers to determine the per-hop behavior (PHB) treatment to which the packet is subjected. Essentially, differentiated services specifies a packet's transmission priority as it passes through each network device on its journey through the network.

<span id="L2_Signaling"></span><span id="l2_signaling"></span><span id="L2_SIGNALING"></span>[L2 Signaling](l2-signaling.md)
</dt> <dd>

The mapping of RSVP objects to Layer 2 (per the ISO OSI Model) signaling, such as Frame Relay Network Devices (FRNDs) or ATM interfaces.

<span id="Subnet_Bandwidth_Manager__SBM_"></span><span id="subnet_bandwidth_manager__sbm_"></span><span id="SUBNET_BANDWIDTH_MANAGER__SBM_"></span>[Subnet Bandwidth Manager (SBM)](subnet-bandwidth-manager.md)
</dt> <dd>

Manages shared-media network bandwidth. In Windows 2000 Quality of Service, SBM functionality is incorporated into Admission Control Service (ACS).

<span id="Resource_Reservation_Protocol__RSVP_"></span><span id="resource_reservation_protocol__rsvp_"></span><span id="RESOURCE_RESERVATION_PROTOCOL__RSVP_"></span>[Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)](rsvp.md)
</dt> <dd>

Carries and disseminates QOS information to QOS-aware network devices along the path between a sender and one or more receivers for a given flow, and also to senders and receivers.
