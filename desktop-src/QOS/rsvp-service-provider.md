# RSVP Service Provider

The RSVP service provider (RSVP SP) is the name for the QOS component that invokes nearly all resulting QOS facilities. The RSVP SP communicates Windows Sockets 2 QOS semantics to the RSVP SP. The Rsvpsp DLL is loaded by Windows Sockets when a QOS-enabled socket is opened.

> [!Note]  
> RSVP signaling is not supported on Windows XP or later versions of Windows.
