## Description

Describes the memory budget for an adapter.

## -struct-fields

### budget

Type: **uint64_t**

Specifies the OS-provided adapter memory budget, in bytes, that your application should target. If *currentUsage* is greater than *budget*, then your application may incur stuttering or performance penalties due to background activity by the OS, which is intended to provide other applications with a fair usage of adapter memory.

### budget

Type: **uint64_t**

Specifies your applicaton's current adapter memory usage, in bytes.

### availableForReservation

Type: **uint64_t**

Specifies the amount of adapter memory, in bytes, that your application has available for reservation. To reserve this adapter memory, your application should call [IDXCoreAdapter::SetState](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-setstate) with *state* set to [DXCoreAdapterState::AdapterMemoryBudget](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate).

### availableForReservation

Type: **uint64_t**

Specifies the amount of adapter memory, in bytes, that is reserved by your application. The OS uses the reservation as a hint to determine your application's minimum working set. Your application should attempt to ensure that its adapter memory usage can be trimmed to meet this requirement.
