## Description

Defines constants that specify types of notifications raised by [IDXCoreAdapter](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter) or [IDXCoreAdapterList](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterlist) objects.

You can register and unregister for these notifications by calling [IDXCoreAdapterFactory::RegisterEventNotification](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterfactory-registereventnotification) and [IDXCoreAdapterFactory::UnregisterEventNotification](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterfactory-unregistereventnotification), respectively.

## Enum fields

### AdapterListStale

This notification is raised by an <a href="/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterlist">IDXCoreAdapterList</a> object when the adapter list becomes stale. The fresh-to-stale transition is one-way, and one-time, so this notification is raised at most one time.

### AdapterNoLongerValid

This notification is raised by an <a href="/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter">IDXCoreAdapter</a> object when the adapter becomes no longer valid. The valid-to-invalid transition is one-way, and one-time, so this notification is raised at most one time.

### AdapterBudgetChange

This notification is raised by an <a href="/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter">IDXCoreAdapter</a> object when an adapter budget change occurs. This notification can occur many times. Using this notification is functionally similar to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_4/nf-dxgi1_4-idxgiadapter3-registervideomemorybudgetchangenotificationevent">IDXGIAdapter3::RegisterVideoMemoryBudgetChangeNotificationEvent</a>. In response to this event, you should call [IDXCoreAdapter::QueryState](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-querystate) (with [DXCoreAdapterState::AdapterMemoryBudget](/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate)) to evaluate the current memory budget state.

### AdapterHardwareContentProtectionTeardown

This notification is raised by an <a href="/windows/desktop/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter">IDXCoreAdapter</a> object to notify of an adapter's hardware content protection teardown. This notification can occur many times. It is functionally similar to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_4/nf-dxgi1_4-idxgiadapter3-registerhardwarecontentprotectionteardownstatusevent">IDXGIAdapter3::RegisterHardwareContentProtectionTeardownStatusEvent</a>. In response to this event, you should re-evaluate the current crypto session status; for example, by calling [ID3D11VideoContext1::CheckCryptoSessionStatus](/windows/desktop/api/d3d11_1/nf-d3d11_1-id3d11videocontext1-checkcryptosessionstatus) to determine the impact of the hardware teardown for a specific [ID3D11CryptoSession](/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nn-d3d11-id3d11cryptosession) interface.
