# Manipulating Work Items

The [**IScheduledWorkItem**](ischeduledworkitem.md) interface provides methods for retrieving and setting work item properties; creating, retrieving, and deleting triggers for work items (setting the trigger must be done with the [**ITaskTrigger::SetTrigger**](itasktrigger-settrigger.md) method); and for running, terminating, and deleting the work item.

> [!Note]  
> For the properties of a specific type of work item, refer to the interface for that type of object. For example, you cannot set the priority level of a work item; however, you can use the methods of the [**ITask**](itask.md) interface to retrieve and set the priority of a task.

Â 

Whenever you modify a work item, you must call the [**IPersistFile::Save**](_com_ipersistfile_save) object to save the modified work item to disk. The [**IPersistFile**](_com_ipersistfile) interface is a standard COM interface that is supported by the [**ITask**](itask.md) interface.
