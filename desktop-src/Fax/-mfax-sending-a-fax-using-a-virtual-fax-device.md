# Sending a Fax Using a Virtual Fax Device

You do not need to follow any special steps to send an outbound fax using a virtual fax device. When you are sending a fax, there is no difference between a physical fax device and a virtual fax device. When a user queues a fax job, the fax service attempts to select the device with the highest transmission priority to send the fax. The device can be a physical device or a virtual device.
