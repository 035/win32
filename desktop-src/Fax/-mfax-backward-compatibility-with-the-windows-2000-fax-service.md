# Backward Compatibility with the Windows 2000 Fax Service

The fax service continues to support the [Fax Service Client API for Windows 2000](-mfax-fax-service-client-api-for-windows-2000.md). Applications that use this API will continue to function under Windows XP and Windows Vista. However, it is recommended that new applications use the [Fax Service Extended COM Implementation](-mfax-about-the-fax-service-extended-com-api.md).
