# Fax Service Extended COM Samples

The Fax Service Extended Component Object Model (COM) documentation includes sample Microsoft Visual Basic applications that demonstrate the use of the extended COM fax objects. Each application includes a complete Visual Basic project, a stand-alone executable file, and a readme text file. The samples are:

-   CancelFax, which demonstrates how to cancel a fax or a group of faxes.
-   CSIDChange, which demonstrates how to make a global transmitting station identifier (TSID) and/or called station identifier (CSID) change for devices on a fax server.
-   QueueMonitor, which demonstrates how to register for fax server events.

You can download the samples from the [SDK Update Site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=48615&clcid=0x409). Download the Core software development kit (SDK). You will find the samples in the root installation directory -&gt; Samples -&gt; NetDS -&gt; Fax.

> [!Note]  
> If you download the complete Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), rather than the Core SDK, you will have to install the Core SDK files by running the x86.msi installation file.
