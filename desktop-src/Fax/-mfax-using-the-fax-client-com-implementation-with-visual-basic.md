# Using the Fax Client COM Implementation with Visual Basic

The Fax Service Client API Component Object Model (COM) interface documentation for Microsoft Visual Basic programmers is organized around [the fax client object model](-mfax-the-fax-client-object-model.md). The documentation for each object includes the following items:

-   A detailed description of the object's functionality
-   A list of properties and methods for the object
-   A Visual Basic example to access the properties and call the methods of the object

Note that the corresponding C/C++ interface method topics contain information that is of interest to Visual Basic programmers. For example, these equivalent topics provide cross-references to related topics and remarks of interest, and they may also contain detailed parameter descriptions.

The C/C++ interface method names begin with **IFax**. Hyperlinks to these topics are provided in the tables describing the Visual Basic properties and methods. For example, when you click the Visual Basic  **Send** method of the [**FaxDoc object**](-mfax-faxdoc-object-visual-basic-.md), it displays the [**IFaxDoc::Send**](-mfax-ifaxdoc-mfax-ifaxdoc-send-cpp.md) method C/C++ reference topic. You can return to the Visual Basic  **FaxDoc** object reference topic from the C/C++ topic by clicking the Visual Basic reference hyperlink located above the C/C++ syntax block.
