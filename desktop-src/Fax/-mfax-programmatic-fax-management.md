# Programmatic Fax Management

The fax service extended Component Object Model (COM) API gives developers a mechanism to manage fax service functionality. You can use the administration objects for automation of all fax service console functions. With this capability administrators can create scripts and programs to automate repetitive tasks requiring the use of the fax service console. These scripts and programs can then be included in batch files. By programming with the same administration objects that the fax service console uses, developers can provide persistent and configurable data storage for their programs, and can have the fax service notify programs when specific events occur.

Using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), developers can also customize fax service by adding new property pages, menus, toolbars, and buttons, and by extending the namespace. See [MMC Snap-in Extensibility Guide](-mfax-mmc-snap-in-extensibility-guide.md) for examples of fax service customization.

You can use C++ programs, Microsoft Visual Basic programs, and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) scripts to administer the fax service. Each extended COM function provided in the fax service software development kit (SDK) provides the Visual Basic and C++ syntax for that function. See [Fax Service Interfaces](-mfax-fax-service-client-api-objects.md) for more information.

Sample applications written in Visual Basic are provided with the fax SDK, which is part of the Windows Core SDK. For more information, see [Fax Service Extended COM Samples](-mfax-fax-service-extended-com-samples.md).
