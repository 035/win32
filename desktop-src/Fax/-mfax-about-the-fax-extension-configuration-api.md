# About the Fax Extension Configuration API

The Fax Extension Configuration API provides an extension configuration persistence mechanism that allows you to persistently store configuration for fax devices without having to write directly to the Fax Service registry. The mechanism is available to all fax extensions, including fax service providers (FSPs) and fax routing extensions.

The extension configuration API also allows your fax extension DLLs to register for and receive notifications from the fax service about changes in device configuration data.

You can access these services for remote configuration modules that you design (for example, for Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins) through a fax extension configuration API.
