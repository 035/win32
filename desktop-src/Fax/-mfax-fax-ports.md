# Fax Ports

Throughout this document, a *fax port* refers to a fax device and all the configuration and inbound routing information associated with the device. The fax service exposes one or more fax ports to the user as endpoints in a fax transmission.

A fax port also exists for a virtual fax device. This permits the outbound transmission of faxes to an endpoint that is not strictly a physical device attached to a fax server. A fax service provider (FSP) that supports fax transmissions over the Internet is an example of a provider that uses a virtual fax device. For more information, see [Virtual Fax Devices](-mfax-virtual-fax-devices.md).
