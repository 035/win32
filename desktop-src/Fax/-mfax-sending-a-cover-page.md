# Sending a Cover Page

The Fax Service Client API supports the printing of optional cover pages. Users can send a common cover page or a personal cover page with a fax document.

If a cover page is required, the user must either supply the full path to a cover page file, or the relative path to a common cover page file.

The following topics provide detailed information about sending a cover page with a fax transmission.

For information about the required storage locations for common and personal cover page files, see [Cover Pages](-mfax-cover-pages.md).
