# Device and Configuration Management

The fax service provides a fax service administration application that is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in component. A fax client application can provide configuration capabilities, or it can use the administration application for the following configuration management tasks.

-   Specifying devices that transmit and receive faxes
-   Specifying routing methods that execute on a port
-   Configuring global service data
