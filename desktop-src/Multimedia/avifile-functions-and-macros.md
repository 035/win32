# AVIFile Functions and Macros

AVIFile functions and macros provide access to time-based files that use the resource information file format (RIFF), such as waveform-audio and audio-video interleaved (AVI) files. These functions and macros manage RIFF files, making it unnecessary for you to manage and navigate through the RIFF architecture.
