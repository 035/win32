# Looping Playback

MCIWnd supports playback as a continuous loop. You can play the content of a file or device repeatedly as a loop by using the [**MCIWndSetRepeat**](/windows/win32/Vfw/nf-vfw-mciwndsetrepeat?branch=master) macro in combination with the **Play** button on the toolbar. The video playback device, MCIAVI, supports playback loops. To determine if continuous playback has been activated, use the [**MCIWndGetRepeat**](/windows/win32/Vfw/nf-vfw-mciwndgetrepeat?branch=master) macro.
