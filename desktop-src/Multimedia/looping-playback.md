# Looping Playback

MCIWnd supports playback as a continuous loop. You can play the content of a file or device repeatedly as a loop by using the [**MCIWndSetRepeat**](mciwndsetrepeat.md) macro in combination with the **Play** button on the toolbar. The video playback device, MCIAVI, supports playback loops. To determine if continuous playback has been activated, use the [**MCIWndGetRepeat**](mciwndgetrepeat.md) macro.
