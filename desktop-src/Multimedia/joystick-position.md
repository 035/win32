# Joystick Position

You can query a joystick for position and button information by using the [**joyGetPos**](joygetpos.md) function. For example, an application can query the joystick for baseline position values. The Joystick Control Panel property sheet uses this technique when calibrating the joystick.

You can also query a joystick or other device that has extended capabilities by using the [**joyGetPosEx**](joygetposex.md) function.
