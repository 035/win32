# Joystick Position

You can query a joystick for position and button information by using the [**joyGetPos**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**joyGetPos**) function. For example, an application can query the joystick for baseline position values. The Joystick Control Panel property sheet uses this technique when calibrating the joystick.

You can also query a joystick or other device that has extended capabilities by using the [**joyGetPosEx**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**joyGetPosEx**) function.
