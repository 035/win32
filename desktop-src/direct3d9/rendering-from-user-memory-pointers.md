# Rendering from User Memory Pointers (Direct3D 9)

A secondary set of rendering interfaces supports passing vertex and index data directly from user memory pointers. These interfaces support a single stream of vertex data only. For more information, see the following reference topics.

-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitiveUP**](idirect3ddevice9--drawprimitiveup.md)
-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP**](idirect3ddevice9--drawindexedprimitiveup.md)

These methods render with data specified by user memory pointers, instead of vertex and index buffers.
