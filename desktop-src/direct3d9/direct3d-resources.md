# Direct3D Resources (Direct3D 9)

Resources are the textures and buffers that are used to render a scene. Applications need to create, load, copy, and use resources. This section gives a brief introduction to resources and the steps and methods used by applications when working with resources.

All resources, including the geometry resources [**IDirect3DIndexBuffer9**](idirect3dindexbuffer9.md) and [**IDirect3DVertexBuffer9**](idirect3dvertexbuffer9.md), inherit from the [**IDirect3DResource9**](idirect3dresource9.md) interface. The texture resources, [**IDirect3DCubeTexture9**](idirect3dcubetexture9.md), [**IDirect3DTexture9**](idirect3dtexture9.md), and [**IDirect3DVolumeTexture9**](idirect3dvolumetexture9.md), also inherit from the [**IDirect3DBaseTexture9**](idirect3dbasetexture9.md) interface.
