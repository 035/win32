# About Enhanced Storage

Enhanced Storage currently supports devices implementing the IEEE 1667 standard (http://www.ieee1667.com) which defines a mechanism of storage target authentication prior to data access. Even more useful is the fact that the standard also defines a generic mechanism by which any customized function implemented by the storage device can be discovered and accessed. For more information on Enhanced Storage, see [Overview of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management Tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=185640).

Enhanced Storage provides Windows applications with methods to:

-   Discover and access additional functions available on an Enhanced Storage device.
-   Discover and invoke function-specific workflow called action for an Enhanced Storage device.
-   Authenticate access to an Enhanced Storage device that supports device authentication.

For additional implementation details, see [Using Enhanced Storage](using-enhanced-storage.md).
