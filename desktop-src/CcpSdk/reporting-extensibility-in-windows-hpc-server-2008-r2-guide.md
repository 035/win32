# Reporting Extensibility in Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 Guide

Windows HPC Server 2008 and Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 provide a set of charts and reports that help HPC cluster administrators monitor the use and performance of the HPC cluster. Cluster administrators can view these charts and reports in the **Charts and Reports** view in HPC Cluster Manager. For more information about these built-in charts and reports, see the [HPC Cluster Manager Help](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=124146) in the Windows HPC Server 2008 Technical Library (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=124146).

In Windows HPC Server 2008 R2, cluster administrators and partners can also create custom reports from the same data sources that HPC Cluster Manager uses for the built-in reports. The available data includes information about the following items:

-   Nodes and their properties

-   Node groups

-   Changes to node states

-   Node availability and use

-   Jobs and their properties

-   Job allocation to individual nodes

-   Job results and duration

-   Job statistics such as task state summaries, CPU time and memory used, and service-oriented architecture (SOA) call duration

-   Performance metrics such as network usage and disk throughput

By adding support for custom reports, Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 allows cluster administrators to get information that is designed for their individual needs about the use and performance of the HPC cluster.

This guide describes the features that Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 includes to provide data for custom reports about cluster use and performance. This guide also presents use cases that demonstrate how to use Microsoft products to analyze and create custom reports from the reporting data that Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 provides.
