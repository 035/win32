# Executing Commands

Commands are special jobs that contain a single task. A command job is not scheduled (it runs immediately) and can be run only by administrators. The specified command must exist on all nodes on which it is to run. By default, the command runs on all nodes in the cluster; however, you can limit it to run on a specified list of nodes.

To create a command, call the [**IScheduler::CreateCommand**](ischeduler-createcommand.md) method. If the command requires specific environment variables, standard input from a file, or must be launched in a specific directory, use the [**ICommandInfo**](icommandinfo.md) interface to specify these requirements.

To start the command, call one of the following methods:

-   [**Start**](iremotecommand-start.md)
-   [**StartWithCredentials**](iremotecommand-startwithcredentials.md)

With the [**Start**](iremotecommand-start.md) method, the user provides the credentials. With the [**StartWithCredentials**](iremotecommand-startwithcredentials.md) method, the user name and password are specified. If the password is not specified, the user provides the password unless the credentials have been cached.

> [!Note]  
> After starting the command, your application must continue to run until the job that run the command finishes. If your application exits too soon, the HPC Job Scheduler Service may not create and start the task that runs the command.

Â 

The command provides the following events to which you may subscribe:

-   [**OnCommandOutput**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandoutput.md)
-   [**OnCommandRawOutput**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandrawoutput.md)
-   [**OnCommandTaskState**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandtaskstate.md)
-   [**OnCommandJobState**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandjobstate.md)

To receive notification when the state of the job that contains the command changes, subscribe to the [**OnCommandJobState**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandjobstate.md) event. To receive notification when the state of the command changes on a node, subscribe to the [**OnCommandTaskState**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandtaskstate.md) event. To receive each line of output as it is generated on a node, subscribe to the [**OnCommandOutput**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandoutput.md) event. The [**OnCommandRawOutput**](iremotecommandevents-oncommandrawoutput.md) event is similar to **OnCommandOutput** except that the output is a byte blob that contains the output as the command writes it (the output could contain one or more lines or be a partial line of output). Note that these callbacks do not block the command from continuing; by the time you handle the notification, the state of the job or task may have already transitioned to a new state.

The following example shows how to create and run a command and how to subscribe to events in C#. For an example that implements the event handler for the events, see [Implementing the Event Handlers for Command Events in C#](implementing-the-event-handlers-for-command-events-in-c-.md).

The following example shows how to create and run a command and how to subscribe to events in C++. If you subscribe to events, you will receive all events (you cannot subscribe to individual events). If you do not want to handle an event, your implementation for the event should simply return. For an example that implements the event handler for the events, see [Implementing the Event Handlers for Command Events in C++](implementing-the-event-handlers-for-command-events-in-c--.md). This example assumes that the *pScheduler* variable is a valid pointer to an [**IScheduler**](ischeduler.md) instance.


```C++
// Created in RunCommand and set in CCommandEventHandler::OnCommandJobState
// when the state of the job changes to Finished, Failed, or Canceled.
HANDLE g_CommandDoneEvent = NULL;
