# IScheduler::SetClusterParameter method

Sets a configuration parameter for the cluster.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT SetClusterParameter(
  [in] BSTR Name,
  [in] BSTR Value
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*Name* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The name of the parameter. The names are case-insensitive.

</dd> <dt>

*Value* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The value of the parameter.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

If the method succeeds, the return value is **S\_OK**. Otherwise, the return value is an error code.

## Remarks

Only a user with administrator privileges can set the cluster's configuration parameters.

You can only update HPC configuration parameters; you cannot delete them. The method fails if the HPC parameter value is not valid.

To retrieve the current configuration values, access the [**IScheduler::ClusterParameters**](ischeduler-clusterparameters.md) scheduler property.

The following are the supported configuration parameters.

| AffinityType<br/>             | Specifies a processor affinity setting that controls the association between tasks and cores. The following list describes the possible values for this parameter:<br/> <dl> <dt><span id="AllJobs"></span><span id="alljobs"></span><span id="ALLJOBS"></span>AllJobs</dt> <dd> Directs the HPC Node Manager Service to set the processor affinity for any task to which an entire node is not allocated. This setting is the best choice for jobs such as parameter sweeps and service-oriented architecture (SOA) jobs, for which multiple instances of the application can run per node and for which you want these instances to be isolated from each other. This setting corresponds to the affinity behavior in Windows HPC Server 2008.<br/> </dd> <dt><span id="NoJobs"></span><span id="nojobs"></span><span id="NOJOBS"></span>NoJobs</dt> <dd> Directs the HPC Node Manager Service to never set the processor affinity on any task. This setting is an excellent choice if you are running MPI tasks and you want to be sure that you can use the -affinity option for the mpiexec command, even when jobs share nodes. This setting is also useful for applications that set their own processor affinity. This setting corresponds to the affinity behavior in Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003.<br/> </dd> <dt><span id="NonExclusiveJobs"></span><span id="nonexclusivejobs"></span><span id="NONEXCLUSIVEJOBS"></span>NonExclusiveJobs</dt> <dd> Directs the HPC Node Manager Service to not set affinity on jobs that are marked as exclusive. This setting is the ideal choice for jobs that contain only one task, because this setting enables that task to take advantage of all cores on the nodes to which the task is assigned. This setting provides new affinity setting behavior for Windows HPC Server 2008 with SP1, and it is the default setting for Windows HPC Server 2008 with SP1, Windows HPC Server 2008 with SP2, and Windows HPC Server 2008 R2, because this setting provides the generally preferred behavior for MPI tasks, which are most likely to be sensitive to affinity settings. When you use this setting, MPI tasks in exclusive jobs can take advantage of the -affinity option of the mpiexec command even if the task is not allocated an entire node.<br/> </dd> </dl> This parameter is supported only for Windows HPC Server 2008 with SP1, Windows HPC Server 2008 with SP2, and Windows HPC Server 2008 R2.<br/> |
| AllowNewUserConnections<br/>  | Specifies whether the HPC Job Scheduler Service should allow users to connect to the HPC Job Scheduler Service to create and submit new jobs and tasks.<br/> A True value indicates that the HPC Job Scheduler Service should allow users to connect to the HPC Job Scheduler Service to create and submit new jobs and tasks. The HPC Job Scheduler Service places the jobs in a queue and runs them in the order that is defined by the scheduling policy for the HPC cluster.<br/> A False value indicates that the HPC Job Scheduler Service should allow only cluster administrators and system services that are running on the head node of the HPC cluster to connect to the HPC Job Scheduler Service, and it should not allow users without administrative credentials to connect to the HPC Job Scheduler Service. Use a setting of False when you are doing maintenance work for the cluster and you need to prevent users from accessing the HPC Job Scheduler Service and its database. For example, you would use a setting of False while you are backing up and restoring the database. This setting does not prevent cluster administrators from creating and submitting jobs and tasks.<br/> The default value of this parameter is True.<br/> When you upgrade an HPC cluster from HPC Pack 2008 to HPC Pack 2008 R2, the AllowNewUserConnections property for the cluster is initially set to False, and it automatically resets to True when the upgrade is complete.<br/> This parameter is supported only for HPC Pack 2008 R2.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ActivationFilterProgram<br/>  | Specifies the path and file name of the activation filter program, if one exists. The activation filter program is called every time a job starts. You can use the activation filter program to delay the start of a job.<br/> This application returns 0 if the job should be started and a nonzero value otherwise. It must accept a single command-line argument, which is an absolute path to an XML file that specifies the terms of the job. The job terms are the attributes of the [**Job**](jobschema-job-element.md) element. The [**CustomProperties**](jobschema-customproperties-job-element.md) element contains the name/value pairs for application-defined extended job terms.

| TaskCancelGracePeriod<br/>    | Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the HPC Node Manager Service should allow applications to use to exit gracefully.<br/> In HPC Pack 2008 R2, the HPC Node Manager Service stops a running task by sending a CTRL+BREAK signal to the application. To make use of the grace period for task cancelation, the application must include code to handle the CTRL+BREAK event.
