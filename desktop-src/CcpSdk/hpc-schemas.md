# HPC Schemas

HPC provides the following schemas:

-   [Job Schema](jobschema-schema.md)
-   [Task Schema](taskschema-schema.md)

You can use the schema to serialize your jobs and tasks and then later use the [**ISchedulerJob::RestoreFromXml**](ischedulerjob-restorefromxml.md) method to update a job or task.

The schemas are located in the Include folder of your Microsoft HPC Pack 2008 SDK installation.
