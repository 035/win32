The [**Graphics**](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics?branch=master) class provides a variety of drawing methods including those shown in the following list:

-   [DrawLine Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawline(in const pen,in const point &,in const point &)?branch=master)
-   [DrawRectangle Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawrectangle(in const pen,in const rect &)?branch=master)
-   [DrawEllipse Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawellipse(in const pen,in const rect &)?branch=master)
-   [DrawArc Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawarc(in const pen,in const rect &,in real,in real)?branch=master)
-   [**Graphics::DrawPath**](/windows/win32/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawpath?branch=master)
-   [DrawCurve Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawcurve(in const pen,in const point,in int)?branch=master)
-   [DrawBezier Methods](/windows/win32/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawbezier(in const pen,in const point &,in const point &,in const point &,in const point &)?branch=master)

One of the arguments that you pass to such a drawing method is the address of a [**Pen**](/windows/win32/gdipluspen/nl-gdipluspen-pen?branch=master) object.
