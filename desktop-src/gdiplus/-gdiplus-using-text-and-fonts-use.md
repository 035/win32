# Using Text and Fonts

Windows GDI+ provides several classes that form the foundation for drawing text. The [**Graphics**](-gdiplus-class-graphics-class.md) class has several [DrawString](-gdiplus-class-graphics-drawstring-methods.md) methods that allow you to specify various features of text, such as location, bounding rectangle, font, and format. Other classes that contribute to text rendering include [**FontFamily**](-gdiplus-class-fontfamily-class.md), [**Font**](-gdiplus-class-font-class.md), [**StringFormat**](-gdiplus-class-stringformat-class.md), [**InstalledFontCollection**](-gdiplus-class-installedfontcollection-class.md), and [**PrivateFontCollection**](-gdiplus-class-privatefontcollection-class.md).
