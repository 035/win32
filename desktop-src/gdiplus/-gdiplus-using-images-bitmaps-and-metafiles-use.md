# Using Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles

Windows GDI+ provides the [**Image**](-gdiplus-class-image-class.md) class for working with raster images (bitmaps) and vector images (metafiles). The [**Bitmap**](-gdiplus-class-bitmap-class.md) class and the [**Metafile**](-gdiplus-class-metafile-class.md) class both inherit from the **Image** class. The **Bitmap** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The **Metafile** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.

The following topics cover the [**Image**](-gdiplus-class-image-class.md), [**Bitmap**](-gdiplus-class-bitmap-class.md), and [**Metafile**](-gdiplus-class-metafile-class.md) classes in more detail:

-   [Loading and Displaying Metafiles](-gdiplus-loading-and-displaying-metafiles-use.md)
-   [Recording Metafiles](-gdiplus-recording-metafiles-use.md)

-   [Using Interpolation Mode to Control Image Quality During Scaling](-gdiplus-using-interpolation-mode-to-control-image-quality-during-scaling-use.md)
-   [Creating Thumbnail Images](-gdiplus-creating-thumbnail-images-use.md)
-   [Using a Cached Bitmap to Improve Performance](-gdiplus-using-a-cached-bitmap-to-improve-performance-use.md)
