# Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles

Windows GDI+ provides the [**Image**](-gdiplus-class-image-class.md) class for working with raster images (bitmaps) and vector images (metafiles). The [**Bitmap**](-gdiplus-class-bitmap-class.md) class and the [**Metafile**](-gdiplus-class-metafile-class.md) class both inherit from the **Image** class. The **Bitmap** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The **Metafile** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.
