# Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles

Windows GDI+ provides the [**Image**](/windows/win32/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-image?branch=master) class for working with raster images (bitmaps) and vector images (metafiles). The [**Bitmap**](/windows/win32/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-bitmap?branch=master) class and the [**Metafile**](/windows/win32/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile?branch=master) class both inherit from the **Image** class. The **Bitmap** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The **Metafile** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.
