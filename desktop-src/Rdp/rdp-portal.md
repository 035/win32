# Windows Desktop Sharing

## Purpose

Windows Desktop Sharing is used by software developers to create applications that use multiple-party screen-sharing technology. Key scenarios include remote assistance, real-time collaboration and conferencing, and video communication. With Remote Desktop Services, a session is always created when a user connects remotely through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With Windows Desktop Sharing, a local desktop can be transmitted over an RDP connection without creating an additional session.
