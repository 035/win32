# Network Management

## Purpose

The network management functions provide the ability to manage user accounts and network resources. Many of the capabilities provided by the network management functions are not provided by other networking functions. However, if the capabilities are provided by another set of functions, the documentation for the network management functions will refer you to other functions you can use for the same task.

## Developer audience

The network management functions are designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Programmers should also be familiar with Windows networking concepts

## Run-time requirements

The network management functions can be used on all Windows platforms. Where certain implementations or capabilities of network management platform restrictions do exist, they are clearly noted in the documentation.
