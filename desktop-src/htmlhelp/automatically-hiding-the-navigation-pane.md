# Automatically Hiding the Navigation Pane

You can design your compiled help (.chm) file so that the [Navigation pane is automatically hidden](to-automatically-hide-the-navigation-pane.md) when a user clicks outside of the HTML Help Viewer. This allows the user to see more of the screen when working in a software program. When the user clicks inside the help topic, the Navigation pane is reopened.

To see an example of a help file that automatically hides the Navigation pane, you can download and view the [help topics for the Help Viewer](html-help-viewer-topics.md) from the HTML Help Web site.
