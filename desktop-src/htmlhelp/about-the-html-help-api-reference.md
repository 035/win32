# About the HTML Help API Reference

The HTML Help API reference provides information about how to hook up help to a Windows program.

The reference provides the following sections:

-   An [Overview](html-help-api-overview.md) section that describes the functionality that the HTML Help API provides. It explains how to call the HTML Help API, its return values, and how to access it from your code. This section also discusses window types and how to define them.
-   A [Reference](about-the-reference-section.md) section that provides comprehensive reference information for all supported items in the HTML Help API. These items include commands, data structures, and notification messages.
