# Updating and Managing a Web Site

After you create a help Web site, an important task is updating and managing the information — making sure that your help Web pages are kept up-to-date and correct. Nothing is more annoying to a user than finding a page that contains outdated information. To make sure this does not happen to your help Web site, schedule time to make changes to your Web pages and to validate all content and links.

A good site management and updating plan should include the following tasks:

-   Adding new help content and information.
-   Updating existing help content and information.
-   Verifying file locations (for example, contents and index files).
-   Verifying internal links to your pages.
-   Verifying links to other pages.
