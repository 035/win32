# Creating a Topic Template

Having a topic template can ease the process of creating new topics by providing a framework to build on. Using topic templates can also help to ensure consistency throughout your help project.

## To create a topic template

1.  [Create an HTML file](creating-html-files.md) and add the sample text, fields, tables, forms, and other design elements that all the files of this type should contain.
2.  Add boilerplate text to make it easy to identify each element.

## Notes

-   To get a better idea of how a topic template might look, you can [view the topic templates](example--topic-templates.md).
-   You can reduce the time it takes to create individual help files or Web pages by distributing a template to all the authors working on a help system or Web site.
