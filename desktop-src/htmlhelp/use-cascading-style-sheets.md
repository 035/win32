# Use Cascading Style Sheets

A cascading style sheet is a separate HTML file that keeps track of design and format information such as the colors, fonts, font sizes, and margins you use in your help files or Web pages. By [linking your HTML files to a cascading style sheet](link-a-style-sheet-to-an-html-file.md), you can easily create a consistent design for all of your files.

For example, suppose that you select a background color, colors for your links and text, and fonts for each heading level in your files. Instead of [specifying that information in each file](to-apply-a-style-to-a-phrase-in-an-html-file.md), you can [create a style sheet.](creating-a-cascading-style-sheet.md). When you want to change those settings in all your files, you change only the style sheet.

You can also create a separate style sheet for different display devices. For example, you can use a style sheet to address the formatting concerns of Braille readers, text-to-speech converters, printers, or specialized browsers that understand the style-sheet instructions.
