# Design for a Web Site

When planning a Web site that uses components of HTML Help, consider the following:

-   Make a design plan based on whether you will be [distributing topics over the Internet, an intranet, or an extranet](distributing-topics-over-the-internet.md).
-   [Create the topic, contents, index and other files](create-a-help-web-site.md) for your Web site.
-   Decide if you want to [register your Web site](registering-a-web-site-with-search-engines.md) with any search engines.
-   Plan for [updating and managing your Web site](updating-and-managing-a-web-site.md).
