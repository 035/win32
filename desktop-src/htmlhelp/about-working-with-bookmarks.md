# About Working with Bookmarks

Suppose you have a very long help topic and you want users to read information that appears in the middle of it, or you are in the middle of a long topic and want to give users a way to get back to the beginning. You can link to information anywhere in a topic by marking the exact location you want a user to jump to.

Help system or Web site authors can create topics that begin with a "hot" list of the most important information contained in the file. Rather than have the user scroll through the file to get to those topics, the author makes each item in the list a bookmark that takes the user directly to the item they click.

Bookmarks also are used with **Back to top** links, text or buttons that help a user navigate from the middle of a file back to the beginning. A table of contents or index entry can also jump to a bookmark.
