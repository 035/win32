# Creating Embedded Help Windows

An embedded window is a custom window that you can create and use to display topics instead of, or in addition to, the Help Viewer, a secondary window, or a custom frameset.

Depending on your design, using an embedded window to display topics requires more interaction between help authors and software developers than the other window types. Typically, a help author creates the design and topics for an embedded window and the help developer uses the [HTML Help API](about-the-html-help-api-reference.md) to hook it up.

> [!Note]  
> To see an example of an embedded help window, open the HTML Help Image Editor, click the **Help** menu, and then click **Help Topics**.
