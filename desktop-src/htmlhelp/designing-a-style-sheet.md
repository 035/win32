# Designing a Style Sheet

The style sheet language most commonly used on the World Wide Web is known as cascading style sheets (CSS). When designing a style sheet, you use the CSS specifications set up by the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3), the organization that develops common protocols for the World Wide Web. The CSS specification and other information about how cascading style sheets work is available from the [W3C Web site](http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style), along with information about other style sheet protocols.

By [using a cascading style sheet](use-cascading-style-sheets.md), you can ensure design consistency across all your help files or Web pages. For example, you can include standard colors and images in your style sheet that will be applied to all of the files in your help system.
