# Manage Large Document Sets

HTML Help Workshop contains several features that you can use to manage large document sets. You can use these features to create help systems that contain multiple contents (.hhc), index (.hhk), and compiled help (.chm) files. They are particularly useful if you are shipping a help system that contains components.

If you are distributing multiple compiled help files, you can:

-   [Merge compiled help files](merging-help-files-at-run-time.md) at run time. This merges the index and full-text search information from multiple compiled help files. Unified index and search information appears in the Navigation pane of the Help Viewer.
-   [Create a table of contents that includes links to other contents files](creating-links-from-one-contents-file-to-another.md). You can use this feature to create a unified table of contents.
-   [Assign information types to your topics](assign-information-types.md) to determine which group of users will see each topic.

If you are distributing a very large compiled help file, you can:

-   Use a [binary contents file](about-binary-contents-files.md), which opens quicker than a site map file at run time.
