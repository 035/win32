# Setting Help Workshop Preferences for Projects

You can change how HTML Help Workshop operates to suit your work style. You can modify how help projects load, and enable sound for projects so you can listen while working on projects. You can also choose how contents and index entries will respond when you single-click or double-click them in HTML Help Workshop.

## What do you want to do?
