# Work with Links

There are many creative ways for help authors to provide jumps or links within a help file or to resources outside a help system. The most common links are those within HTML files, from one HTML file to another, or to a Web site or server location.

You can also link to other help systems or to multimedia files. You can add buttons that link to topics or locations, or link to topics that appear in a different window than the topic from which you are linking.

Here are some of the ways you can link information:

-   [Create text links](creating-text-links.md).
-   Create a [bookmark](working-with-bookmarks.md) to link from one location in an HTML file to another location within the same file.
-   Create a [link from a contents or index entry](creating-links-to-the-web.md) to a topic on a Web site.
-   Create a [link to another help file](creating-links-to-other-help-files.md).
-   Create a [Related Topics](to-add-related-topics-links-to-a-file.md) link to other HTML files.
-   Create a [KLink](working-with-klinks.md) based on a keyword you and other authors create in your HTML files. Keywords also appear in the index.
-   Create an [ALink](working-with-alinks.md) based on an ALink name you or other authors create in your HTML files. ALink names do not appear in the index.
-   Create a [button that links to a topic](add-buttons-to-help-windows.md) (such as a home page), another location, or another file.
-   Create a link to a topic that opens in a [different window](create-help-windows.md).
