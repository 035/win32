# Create a Table of Contents File

The help table of contents (.hhc) file is an HTML file that contains the topic titles for your table of contents. When a user opens the table of contents in a compiled help file (or on a Web page) and clicks a topic title, the HTML file associated with that title will open.

Using HTML Help Workshop, you can:

-   [Create a table of contents](creating-a-contents-file.md).
-   [Create a table of contents for a Web page](creating-a-table-of-contents-for-a-web-site.md).
-   [Create contents entries that have links](to-assign-an-alternate-location-for-a-contents-or-index-entry.md) to topics stored on a Web site.
-   [Customize the appearance](customizing-a-table-of-contents.md) of your contents file.
-   [Assign information types](assign-information-types.md) to contents entries to select the audience topics will be delivered to.
-   [Create contents files for large document sets](about-binary-contents-files.md)
