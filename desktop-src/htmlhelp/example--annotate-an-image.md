# Example: Annotate an Image

You can add pop-up help topics to an image by using an image map in conjunction with the HTML Help ActiveX control. This lets you associate a pop-up window with each region of an image. When a user clicks an area of the image, a pop-up window will display the topic that goes with that area. This example is based on the [TextPopup](textpopup-method.md) method.

The steps of the process are as follows:

1.  [Create an image map.](to-create-an-image-map.md)
2.  [Write text for pop-up windows.](to-write-text-for-pop-up-windows.md)
3.  [Add the image to your project (.hhp) file.](to-add-the-image-to-your-project-file.md)
4.  [Insert the HTML Help ActiveX control in your HTML file.](to-insert-the-html-help-activex-control-in-your-html-file.md)
5.  [Add hyperlinks to each region of the image map.](to-add-hyperlinks-to-each-region-of-the-image-map.md)

> [!Note]  
> You can use this example with both uncompiled HTML files and compiled help (.chm) files.
