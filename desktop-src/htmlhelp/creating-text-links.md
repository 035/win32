# Creating Text Links

You can create a text link to jump from one HTML file to another in your help project, or from an HTML file to an external Web site or server location. A text link can consist of one character or several paragraphs, but authors typically limit them to a word or a short phrase.

If you use the default setting for HTML Help Workshop, text links appear in a browser as underlined, colored text; the original color changes after a user clicks the link.
