# Testing Links, Pop-up Windows, and Related Topics

When testing a help file, you should also ensure that all hyperlinks, pop-up windows, and Related Topics links are working correctly.

## Suggested tasks for testing

-   View every topic in the help file and test all hyperlinks, and Related Topics links to make sure they connect to the expected location.
-   Open the help file and test all of the links from the **Contents** tab to make sure they all lead to the correct topic.
-   Make sure that the topics you link to appear in the correct window type.
