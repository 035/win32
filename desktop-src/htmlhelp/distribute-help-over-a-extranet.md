# Distribute Help over a Extranet

Help topics distributed over an extranet are usually accessed by users who first visit a World Wide Web site, and then gain access to an extranet so they can use the consumer services being offered. Extranets are frequently connected to large databases that process either requests or information from users, and then generate responses to those requests.

Depending on how the extranet is set up, access to it can either be public or private. All or part of an extranet site can contain help topics that users with access privileges can view, copy, or download to their computer.

Help topics developed for extranet distribution will reach only those who choose to connect to the extranet to obtain the services being offered. The information in them should be designed specifically for the company or consumer using the service.

Using HTML Help Workshop, you can design shortcut buttons in help topics that interact with software programs on the extranet.
