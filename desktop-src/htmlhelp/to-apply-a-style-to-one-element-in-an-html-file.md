# To apply a style to one element in an HTML file

In the HTML file, position your cursor at the location where you want to apply the style.

Using the &lt;STYLE&gt; tag, add the style to the element. For example:


```
<p STYLE= "
font-family: times;
font-size: 12pt
> paragraph text ...</p>
```



where the font and size &lt;STYLE&gt; tag attributes are applied to the text between the &lt;P&gt; start and end tags.

> [!Note]  
> Use this method only if you want to change one element in a file without modifying the style sheet.
