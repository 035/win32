# About Graphics and Multimedia Files

Your HTML topic files can contain links to graphic, sound, video, animation, and other multimedia files. Links to these files are made using the standard HTML tags for each type of file. HTML Help Workshop also includes a graphics editing tool named the HTML Help Image Editor that makes it easy to take screen shots and [add them to your help files](to-specify-the-location-of-image-or-multimedia-files.md). Graphic files have a .gif, .jpeg, or .png file name extension. Common multimedia file name extensions are: .au, .avi, .midi, and .wav.
