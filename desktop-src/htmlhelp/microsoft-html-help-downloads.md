## System Requirements

You must set up Microsoft Internet Explorer (3.0 or later) on your computer before using HTML Help. Internet Explorer 4.0 or later is recommended. If you haven't already, please download the latest version of Internet Explorer. For more information, visit <http://www.microsoft.com/ie>.

HTML Help requires about 8 MB of free disk space.

## Notes

> \[!Important\]  
> Close any open instances of HTML Help Workshop before reinstalling or updating to a new version. If you do not, the HTML Help ActiveX control may be registered incorrectly.

 

To install, right-click the link to the desired file, select "Save Target As", and choose a location on your local computer. After the file is downloaded, you can double-click on it to run the installer.

Windows XP, 2000, ME, and 98 users should not run Hhupd.exe. Any urgent updates will be handled by means of service packs or Windows Update.

-   Windows XP and 2000 users can get updates from [Microsoft Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com).
-   Windows ME users can get updates from [Windows ME Update](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsme/update/default.asp).
-   Windows 98 users can get updates from the [811630 Security Update page](http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/contents/WUCritical/q811630/default.asp).

The HTML Help Installation and Update Package (any language version of Hhupd.exe) will not run on a Windows NT system unless you have administrator privileges.

There are no plans to add any new features to HTML Help.
