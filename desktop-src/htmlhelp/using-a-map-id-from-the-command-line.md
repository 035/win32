# Using a Map ID from the Command Line

From a DOS prompt or from the **Run** command, type:

**-mapid** *id*

where **-mapid** is the switch, and *id* is the ID of the HTML file or other file you want to appear.

## Notes

-   You can use this as a standalone command or add it to a program or to a Windows shortcut.
-   Client-side command line switches are part of the HTML Help executable program (Hh.exe) and therefore work when HTML Help Workshop is not set up.
