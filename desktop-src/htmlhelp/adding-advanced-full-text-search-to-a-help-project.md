# Adding Advanced Full-Text Search to a Help Project

[Adding advanced full-text search](to-add-a-search-tab-to-the-navigation-pane.md) allows a user to search using Boolean, wildcard, and nested expressions. A user can also limit the search to previous results, match similar words, or search topic titles only. When advanced full-text search is enabled, the **Search** tab in the Help Viewer is enhanced.

To see an example of advanced full-text search, click the **Search** tab in this help file.
