# About Image Editing

The HTML Help Image Editor enables you to do two types of color depth reductions with optimized 16- and 256-color palettes, and to obtain an exact color count for each image. Optimized scaling allows sizing of screen captures without loss of text clarity.

Expansion and contraction enables you to select a specific pixel size for an image, and padding is added to the sides or top and bottom to achieve the desired size.

Automatic clipping, primarily for screen captures, cleanly clips out borders and excess area around an image. The Re-read (or revert) function enables you to return to the last saved version of a file. The HTML Help Image Editor also enables you to undo up to nine actions per file during a working session.
