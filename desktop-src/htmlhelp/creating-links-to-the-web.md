# Creating Links to the Web

Help topics can be placed on the Internet, an intranet, or a network location. Then they can be linked to from a contents entry, index entry, or text link. This allows help authors to create new topics or revise existing topics, and then post them to a location other than the original help file.

This is a useful feature if, for example, you have last-minute changes to procedures that can't be included in the original help file. Rather than provide incorrect information, you can provide a table of contents entry to a Web site. The user can then click the entry and, if you have supplied the correct address, the topic will appear.

> [!Note]  
> Topics located on a Web site, intranet, or other location may not be available to users who do not have Internet or network access.
