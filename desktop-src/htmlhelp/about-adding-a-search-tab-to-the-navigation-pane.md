# About Adding a Search Tab to the Navigation Pane

A compiled help file can include a **Search** tab that allows a user to search through every word in a help file to find a match. For example, if a user does a full-text search on the word "index," every topic that contains the word "index" will be listed.

Depending on how complex your help system is, the Search tab can contain either [basic](to-add-a-search-tab-to-the-navigation-pane.md) or [advanced full-text search](adding-advanced-full-text-search-to-a-help-project.md) functionality. Advanced full-text search allows a user to search using Boolean, wildcard, and nested expressions.

### Notes

-   To see an example of Advanced full-text search, click the **Search** tab in this help file. To see an example of a basic search, click the **Search** tab in the [HTML Help Viewer topics](html-help-viewer-topics.md) Help file.
-   You can decrease the time it takes for a full-text search by including a [full-text search stop word list](to-add-a-full-text-search-stop-list-to-a-help-project.md) in your help project.
