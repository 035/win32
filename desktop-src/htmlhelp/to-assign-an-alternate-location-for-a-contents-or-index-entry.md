# To assign an alternate location for a contents or index entry

1.  Open a contents (.hhc) or index (.hhk) file, and then click the entry you want to assign an alternate location for.
2.  Click **Edit Selection**, and then click **Add/Edit**. 

    |                          |                                                                                                   |
    |--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-edsel.gif) | Edits the associated name, file, URL, keyword or style information for the selection. <br/> |

    

     

3.  In the **File or URL** box, enter the alternate location.

## Note

You can use this feature to link from a contents or index entry to a Web site. It is also useful, for example, when information that is not available at the time your help content ships will be available on a Web site. You can add a placeholder topic that will link to the alternate location.
