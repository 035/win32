# Designing a Topic Template

You can create [HTML topic templates](use-topic-templates.md) to greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to create each topic file. A topic template is an HTML file that contains all the font, style, heading, and design elements you use most frequently. Topic templates can be used as the basis for all the content in your help system or Web site.

Design your templates to contain all the basic elements a help author will need to create a specific topic type. For example, in an information system containing many overview topics, you can create an Overview template that contains all the basic style and design elements, in addition to boilerplate text.
