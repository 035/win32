# To add an ALink name to a target HTML file

1.  Open an HTML file.
2.  Position your cursor anywhere between the &lt;BODY&gt; start and end tags of the file, at the location where you want to add the Associative link (ALink) names.
3.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Compiler Information**, and then click the **ALink Names** tab.
4.  Click **Add**, and then enter any ALink names. You can add multiple names by separating each name with a semicolon.

## Notes

-   This adds an &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag with the ALink names you have added to your HTML file. The file is now a target file and you can [create an ALink](to-create-an-alink-in-a-topic-that-links-to-a-target-file.md) from another HTML file to it.
-   You can [test ALinks](to-test-klinks-or-alinks.md) in compiled help files.
-   For more information about ALinks, see the [HTML Help ActiveX control reference](alink.md).
