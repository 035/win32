# To test KLinks or ALinks

1.  On the **Test** menu, click **Keyword Lookup**.
2.  In the **Compiled file** box, enter the name of the compiled help (.chm) file that contains the Keyword links (KLinks) or Associative links (ALinks) you want to test.
3.  If you want the topics you are testing to appear in a window type other than the default window, specify the name of the window type in the **Window name** box.
4.  If you want to include ALink names in the test, select the **Use ALink names** check box.
5.  Click **Add**, type any keywords and ALink names, and then click **Test**.

## Note

This procedure is useful when you need to test whether [KLink keywords](to-add-a-klink-keyword-to-an-html-file.md) and [ALink names](to-add-an-alink-name-to-a-target-html-file.md) have been added correctly to target files and whether the [KLink](to-create-a-klink-in-an-html-file-to-a-keyword-in-a-target-file.md) or [ALink](to-create-an-alink-in-a-topic-that-links-to-a-target-file.md) &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag has been added to the files you want to link from.
