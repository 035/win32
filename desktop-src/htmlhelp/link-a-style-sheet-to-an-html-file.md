# Link a Style Sheet to an HTML File

You can include style sheet information in an HTML file in two ways:

-   Use the **&lt;LINK&gt;** tag to reference an external style sheet contained in a separate file.
-   Include style sheet information between the **&lt;STYLE&gt;** start and end tags inside the file.

The formatting appears the same with either method. If you are managing a large help system or Web site, the advantage to using an external style sheet is that the same styles can be used by many different files, without duplicating the information between the **&lt;HEAD&gt;** start and end tags of every file.
