# Test a Help System

One of the most important things you can do to make sure users find the information they need in your help system is to [test your help files](testing-help-files.md). It is a good idea to test often as you work on your help file, and do a final test of everything before you distribute it.

You want to make sure that all the links in your files work, your table of contents and index are functional, your content is correct, your design is consistent, and there are not any other errors in your file that could confuse users.

To get an idea of how a help system might be tested, you can follow the [process used by the HTML Help team to test help files](creating-a-process-for-testing.md).
