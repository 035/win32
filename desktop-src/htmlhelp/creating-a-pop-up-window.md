# Creating a Pop-up Window

A pop-up window is a window that appears on top of a help topic. The pop-up window sizes automatically to fit the amount of text or the size of the image in it. Pop-up windows remain on the screen until users click anywhere inside or outside of them. You can use pop-up windows, for example, to create pop-up glossary definitions.

You can also [create context-sensitive pop-up help](about-context-sensitive-pop-up-help.md), which is accessed from a program.
