# Creating Secondary Windows

A secondary window is a custom window that you can create and use to display topics instead of, or in addition to, the Help Viewer or a custom frameset. You can define up to 255 secondary windows, and users can display up to 9 of these windows at a time.

> [!Note]  
> You can customize a secondary window to have the same features as the Help Viewer or to have fewer features.
