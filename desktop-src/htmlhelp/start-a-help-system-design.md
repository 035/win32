# Start a Help System Design

Here are some suggestions for planning a help system or Web site:

-   Decide whether you will distribute your help system [with a program](design-help.md), [or on a Web site](design-for-a-web-site.md).
-   Determine who your audience is and, if you will distribute with a program, whether you want to use [information types](assign-information-types.md) to direct topics to specific users.
-   If you will distribute with a program, decide whether you want to display topics in the [Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md) or [create your own frameset](create-a-frameset.md). If you are creating a Web site, plan page designs. For frameset and Web site design, plan which documents will contain the HTML Help ActiveX control.
-   Plan a [design for your topics](designing-help-topics.md), [create HTML template files](designing-a-topic-template.md), and begin writing.
-   Plan a [design for your table of contents](planning-a-table-of-contents.md) and [index](planning-an-index.md).
-   If you will distribute with a program, design any secondary [help windows](designing-help-windows.md) or modifications to the Help Viewer you want to use.
-   [Create a help project](creating-a-project-file.md) (.hhp) file to manage your help files.
