# Create a Frameset

When designing for a help Web site, you may choose to [create a frameset](example--create-a-two-frame-html-frameset.md) for your help content. After you have created a frameset, you [add the HTML Help ActiveX control](inserting-the-html-help-activex-control.md) to the frames that you want to have help functionality.

Framesets are a way of specifying multiple, independent, scrollable regions within a browser window. Each frame can contain a separate HTML document. You can have frames that scroll and resize, depending on how you author the frameset.

You need to assign a name to each frame you create. This will enable you to link from one frame to another. For example, one frame can contain a table of contents and another frame topics. When a user clicks an entry in the table of contents a topic opens in the other frame.

You can use the HTML Help ActiveX control to add the following to your frameset:

-   [A table of contents.](creating-a-contents-file.md)
-   [An index.](creating-an-index-for-a-web-site.md)
-   [Related topic links.](to-add-related-topics-links-to-a-file.md)
-   [Links to a WinHelp file or topic.](to-link-from-a-topic-in-a-html-help-file-to-a-topic-in-a-winhelp-file.md)
-   [A splash screen.](splash.md)
-   [Pop-up windows.](creating-a-pop-up-window.md)
-   A link that opens a dialog box displaying the version number of the HTML Help ActiveX control.

## Notes

-   If you don't want to create your own frameset to display topics you can use the [Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md). There is a performance gain when using the Help Viewer.
-   You can [link to a compiled help file](running-a-compiled-help-file-from-the-web.md) from a Web site, and have your users download the file, instead of designing your help to appear on the Web.
