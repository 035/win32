# Create a Help Project

An HTML help project (.hhp) file is a text file that brings together all the elements of a help project. It contains the data HTML Help Workshop needs to combine topic (.html, .htm), image (.jpeg, .gif, .png), index (.hhk), and contents (.hhc) files into a single compiled help (.chm) file.

The project file also contains information about how a compiled help file will appear. Window definitions you create in the project file determine attributes of your help windows, such as size and position.

As a help author, you [create the project file](creating-a-project-file.md) and [add to it the locations](adding-index--contents--and-image-locations.md) of your topic, contents, index, and other files. You can [modify the project file options](editing-project-options.md) and [customize your help windows](create-help-windows.md) to match the design of your system. You can make other changes depending on the size and complexity of your help system.

When you create a new project, contents, or index file, the minimum necessary settings are added automatically. The project file is divided into sections; for example, \[FILES\] and \[OPTIONS\] are included in every help project file. You can edit these sections by double-clicking the section title.

After your project file is complete, you [compile it](compile-a-help-project.md) to create the final help file. Then you [test the help file](compile-and-test-help.md) to make sure everything appears the way you want it.
