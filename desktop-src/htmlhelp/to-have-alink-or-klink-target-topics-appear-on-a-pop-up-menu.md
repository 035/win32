# To have ALink or KLink target topics appear on a pop-up menu

1.  Open the HTML file in which you want to have the Associative link (ALink) or Keyword link (KLink) target topics appear as items on a pop-up menu.
2.  Click **HTML Help ActiveX Control**.

    

    |                        |                                                                                                                          |
    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-wiz.gif) | Opens the HTML Help ActiveX Control Wizard, which enables you to insert or edit the control in an HTML file. <br/> |

    

     

3.  In the **Specify the command** box, click **ALink Search** or **KLink Search**. If you are going to use scripting to access the command, enter the ID name to use for this instance of the HTML Help ActiveX control.
4.  Click **Button** if you want the ALink or KLink Search command to appear as a button or **Hidden** if you want to use a [text link](create-a-text-link-for-html-help-activex-control-commands.md) for this instance of the HTML Help ActiveX control.
5.  Select the **Display on a Pop-up Menu** check box, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

## Notes

-   Topics appear in a **Topics Found** dialog box by default.
-   For more information about ALinks, KLinks, and other commands, see the [HTML Help ActiveX control reference](about-commands.md).
