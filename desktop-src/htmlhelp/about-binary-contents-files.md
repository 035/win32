# About Binary Contents Files

You can reduce the time it takes to load a very large table of contents by [creating a binary contents file](to-create-a-binary-contents-file.md). A binary table of contents is populated based on user demand. For example, in a table of contents where a book is located within another book, the second level book will not be populated until a user clicks it.

The binary format, however, has a very limited set of authoring features. For example:

-   Only book and page icons are supported.
-   Custom icons are not supported.
-   Information types are not supported.
-   You cannot author a table of contents link to open a topic in a default window or default frame.
-   You cannot modify window styles.
