# About Making Information Type Selection Available to Users

If you assign information types to any topics in the table of contents, the user can customize which topics they see. They can do this by opening a compiled help file, clicking on the [Contents](contents.md) tab, and then right-clicking anywhere in the Navigation pane of the Help Viewer.

Another way to provide information type selection for users is to add an **Options** button to [any secondary windows you create](creating-secondary-windows.md). The user clicks the **Options** button on the button bar, and then clicks **Customize**.
