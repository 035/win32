# Specify the program to open, parameters, and window class

1.  In the **Program** box, enter the name of the program you are calling.
2.  In the **Parameters** box, enter any parameters you would like to send the program (for example, the name of a file to open).
3.  Enter the window class for the program you are calling in the **Window class** box. Doing this makes it so that only one copy of the program will be run. You can leave this box blank if you want to.

> [!Note]  
> You can open a Windows control panel by specifying the appropriate file in the **Program** box. Windows control panels are identified by the .cpl filename extension.
