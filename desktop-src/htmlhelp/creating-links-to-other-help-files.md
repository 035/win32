# Creating Links to Other Help Files

How you link to another compiled help (.chm) file depends on how you want the help file or a topic to appear.

For example, you can link from a Web page to a compiled help file, or from a contents or index entry in the Help Viewer to a topic in another help file. The type of link you use depends on the location you are linking from and where you want to link to.

You can link to a compiled help (.chm) file using a standard HTML link:

-   [Open a compiled help file from a Web page or topic file.](running-a-compiled-help-file-from-the-web.md)
-   [Open a compiled help file from a contents or index entry.](to-open-a-compiled-help-file-from-a-contents-or-index-entry.md)

However, using this method you cannot open a specific topic in a compiled help file. The file will open with the default topic displayed.

Alternatively, you can create a link to a specific topic in a compiled help file and display it in your current browser window or the Help Viewer. Using this method, you can:

-   [Link to a topic in a compiled help file from a Web page or topic file.](to-link-to-a-topic-in-a-compiled-help-file-from-a-web-page-or-topic-file.md)
-   [Link from a contents or index entry to a topic in another compiled help file.](to-link-from-a-contents-or-index-entry-to-a-topic-in-another-compiled-help-file.md)
-   [Link from a topic in a WinHelp file to a topic in an HTML Help file.](to-link-from-a-topic-in-a-winhelp-file-to-a-topic-in-an-html-help-file.md)
