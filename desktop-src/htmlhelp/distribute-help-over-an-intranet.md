# Distribute Help over an Intranet

Help topics can be distributed over an intranet, which is a communications network based on the same technology as the World Wide Web that is available only to people within a certain organization or company. Intranets are protected from unauthorized entrance by a firewall, a computer that refuses entrance to those without proper access privileges. All or part of an intranet site can contain help topics that a user with access privileges can view, copy, or download to their computer.

HTML files distributed on an intranet will reach only those who can connect to the private network on which they are located. The information in them can be confidential and designed specifically for the company or organization using the intranet.
