# Making Topic or Web Page Connections

As a help author, one of your most important design considerations is setting up a clear and simple pattern to quickly get users to the help content they need.

An [HTML help topic or Web page](designing-help-topics.md) is part of a collection of similar help topics or Web pages that make up a help system or Web site. When a user browses the topics in your help file or Web site, they jump from page to page by clicking [hyperlinks](work-with-links.md). A link is a word, phrase, or image that is highlighted and jumps to a specified location when the user clicks it.

If you [add the HTML Help ActiveX control](html-help-activex-control-overview.md) to your help topics or Web pages, you can connect users to information by [creating a table of contents](create-a-table-of-contents-file.md) or [index](create-an-index-file.md) for your topics. You can [add buttons](add-buttons-to-help-windows.md) to the button bar in the Help Viewer or to the windows you design in order to help users navigate to information.

Help topics also can be designed as [context-sensitive topics](designing-context-sensitive-help.md) that appear in a pop-up window when a user right-clicks a dialog box.
