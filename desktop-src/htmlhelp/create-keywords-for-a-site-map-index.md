# Create Keywords for a Site Map Index

A site map index is automatically generated whenever you create an index (.hhk) file and do not compile it. You create keywords by [adding them to the index file](to-add-a-keyword-to-an-index-file.md).

You have complete control over how a site map index is sorted and can [edit](edit-an-index-file.md) and create custom sort orders for your index.

## Notes

-   Keyword links (KLinks) and Associative links (ALinks) are not available when you use a site map index.
-   A site map index will also be created if you select "1.0" as the version in the **Compatibility** box, on the **Compiler** tab, in the **Project Options** dialog box.
