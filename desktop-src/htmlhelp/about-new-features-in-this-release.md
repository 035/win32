# About New Features in this Release

This version of Microsoft HTML Help contains several new features. New features introduced in each version of HTML Help are listed here:

**v1.4**

-   Two system policies have been introduced to address various security issues related to the Shortcut and WinHelp commands.
-   Various other bug fixes.

**v1.33**

-   It is now possible to view help files that were created on different language versions of Windows.
-   Satellite .dll files enable help in all supported languages. Now help will always match the language of the installed operating system.
-   There is now a single version of Hhupd.exe that works in all supported languages.

**v1.32**

-   Various stability enhancements.
-   Bidirectional language support has been fixed for embedded TOC and index controls (embedded controls use the &lt;object&gt; tag in HTML files). Right-to-left layout is now supported.
-   Improved support for Thai language systems.

**v1.31**

-   Windows 95, Windows 98: Changing the language in regional settings no longer changes the language of the Help viewer. This corrects a situation where the language of the Help viewer could be changed to a language not installed on the system.
-   A DLL registration problem in earlier Workshop versions has been corrected.
-   Workshop now includes the 1.31 update. When you run Htmlhelp.exe, Help is automatically updated to 1.31.
