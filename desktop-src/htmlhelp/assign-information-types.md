# Assign Information Types

Information types allow you to customize your help topics to specify that designated topics will reach a particular audience. To achieve this, you [create categories](creating-categories-for-information-types.md) and [information types](creating-information-types.md), select attributes for them, and assign help topics to them.

Information types have an Exclusive, Inclusive or [Hidden](about-the-hidden-information-type.md) attribute. By assigning one or more information types with an Inclusive or Exclusive attribute, you can determine which topics a group of users will see in the table of contents. By assigning a Hidden attribute, you can invoke the HTMLHelp API to connect topics to events in a program.
