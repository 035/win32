# HTML Help Viewer Topics

The HTML Help Viewer topics contain basic information about how to use the viewer. Information on using the accessibility shortcut keys is included. If you are a help author, you can include these topics in your help file.

You can download a compiled help (.chm) file that contains the Help Viewer topics from the [HTML Help Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=154968) (this file is included with the documentation). You can then [decompile the help file](decompiling-a-help-file.md), revise the topics to conform to your guidelines, and include them in your help system.
