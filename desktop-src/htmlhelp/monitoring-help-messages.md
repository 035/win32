# Monitoring Help Messages

You can view help messages to troubleshoot context-sensitive help. Help messages contain the text of each HTML Help API call that is made. Each time you activate context sensitive help in your application, a new message appears including parameters such as the topic ID, text file, and compiled help file that were referenced in the call. These messages can be saved as a text file.
