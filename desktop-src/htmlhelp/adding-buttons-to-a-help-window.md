Alternatively, you can display a help window without the Navigation pane, or set up your window to [automatically hide the Navigation pane](to-modify-the-navigation-pane-in-the-help-viewer.md) when it is opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Locate    | Shows where the current topic is located in the table of contents. If the current topic is not listed in the table of contents, this command will not work.

| Back      | Jumps to the previous topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
