# About Art Manuscripts

Use the art manuscript feature in the HTML Help Image Editor to create or update a catalog of the art in your project. The manuscript itself is an HTML file that contains a thumbnail image of each piece of art. From your manuscript, you can click on the thumbnail images to access the individual art files.
