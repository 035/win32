# To create an 800 X 600 window from the command line

From a command prompt or from the **Run** command, type -800.

Use the -title switch if you want [a title](to-specify-a-title-for-a-window-from-the-command-line.md) to appear in the window title bar.

## Notes

-   This creates an 800 X 600 display window that does not cover the Windows taskbar at the bottom of the screen. You can use it as a stand-alone command or add it to a program or to a Windows shortcut.
-   This command is ignored if you have specified any default window types in your compiled help file.
-   Client-side command line switches are part of the HTML Help executable program (Hh.exe) and therefore work when HTML Help Workshop is not set up.
