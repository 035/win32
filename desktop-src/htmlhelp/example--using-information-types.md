# Example: Using Information Types

Assigning information types to topics is a helpful way to get relevant information to subsets of users. Here are some examples of how you might use information types:

-   You are authoring documentation with novice, intermediate, and expert users as your audience. You define information types that identify each topic in the table of contents according to which type of user it is authored for.
-   Your software is broken into components. However, not all components are included when you ship your software and its documentation to other countries/regions. You can define information types to display only those topics for the components that are shipped.
-   One component of your software program is used primarily by developers, while another is used primarily by testers. You can assign information types to your topics so that testers need to install only the help topics relevant to them.
-   You are creating separate introduction, overview, and step-by-step topics. You can assign information types to table of contents entries for each topic type.
-   Your documentation is for a product that runs on multiple operating systems. You can define information types that identify and display topics according to the operating system the user is running.
