# About the Accessibility Word List

[The accessibility word list](the-accessibility-word-list.md) is a list containing words that are commonly used either to describe physical disabilities or features in software programs that assist users with disabilities. For example, the accessibility word list contains the words "blind" and "selection cursor, adjusting for improved visibility."

Help authors can use the word list as a reminder to include topics on all areas of accessibility in any documentation they provide. Items from the word list can also be added as table of contents entries or as keywords to index files. This will enable users with disabilities to easily find the information they need about your software product.
