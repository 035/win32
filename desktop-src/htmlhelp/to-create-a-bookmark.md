# To create a bookmark

1.  Bookmark a location in an HTML file using the following syntax:

    ```
    <a name="Bookmark">Text</a> 
    ```

    

    where `Bookmark` is name of the bookmark and `Text `is the word or phrase you want the bookmark to link to.

2.  Then create a link to the bookmark using the following syntax:

    ```
    <a href="#Bookmark">Link</a> 
    ```

    

    where `#Bookmark `specifies the bookmark to link to and `Link `is the link text.

## Note

Bookmarks refer to links that are in the middle of an HTML file. You can also [link to a bookmark in another topic file](to-link-to-a-bookmark-in-another-html-file.md).
