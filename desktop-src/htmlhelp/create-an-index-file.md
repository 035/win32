# Create an Index File

The index (.hhk) file is an HTML file that contains the index entries (keywords) for your index. When a user opens the index in a compiled help file, or on a Web page, and clicks a keyword, the HTML file associated with the keyword will open.

Using HTML Help Workshop, you can:

-   [Create an index for a Web page](creating-an-index-for-a-web-site.md).
-   [Create keywords with multiple targets](creating-a-keyword-with-multiple-targets.md).
-   [Create keywords that have links to other help files or to Web pages](to-assign-an-alternate-location-for-a-contents-or-index-entry.md).
-   [Create a keyword that jumps to another keyword (similar to a See Also in a book index)](to-set-an-index-keyword-to-jump-to-another-keyword.md).
-   [Assign information types to keywords](assign-information-types.md).
-   [Set a keyword to be inactive](to-set-an-index-keyword-to-be-inactive.md).

After you have created a help system or a Web site, you can view the index file in the Help Viewer or by using a Web browser.
