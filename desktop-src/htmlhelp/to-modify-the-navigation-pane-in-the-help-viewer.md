4.  If you want to change the default width for the left pane of the Help Viewer, enter a new width in the **Navigation Pane** box.
5.  Select the **Open with Navigation pane closed** check box if you want the compiled help file to open with the Navigation pane closed.
6.  Select the **Auto sync** check box if you want the heading or topic in the **Navigation** pane to automatically synchronize with whatever topic appears in the **Topic** pane.
7.  In the **Default tab** box choose which tab will appear in the **Navigation** pane when the help file is first opened.
8.  In the **Tabs** area, select the tabs that you want to appear on the Navigation pane.

## Notes

-   To customize the Help Viewer, you must create a new window. Any changes to your new window are then noted in the \[WINDOWS\] section of the project (.hhp) file.
-   You can also [create a window without a Navigation pane](to-create-a-window-without-a-navigation-pane.md).
