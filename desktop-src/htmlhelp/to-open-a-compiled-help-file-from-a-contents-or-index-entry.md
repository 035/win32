# To open a compiled help file from a contents or index entry

1.  Open a contents (.hhc) or index (.hhk) file.
2.  Click **Insert a Page** or **Insert a Keyword**.

    

    |                          |                                                                                                                      |
    |--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-inspg.gif) | Adds a page level icon to a table of contents with its associated name, file, URL, and style information.<br/> |

    

     

    

    |                          |                                                                                                                  |
    |--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-inkey.gif) | Adds a keyword to an index with its associated keyword name, file, URL, and destination information. <br/> |

    

     

3.  In the **Entry title** or **Keyword** box, type a name for the table of contents or index link.
4.  Click **Add**, and then, in the **File or URL** box, type the name of the compiled help (.chm) file.

## Notes

-   When a user clicks the link, a dialog box will appear that gives them the option of saving the compiled help file to their hard disk or opening it from the directory where it's located.
-   If the compiled help file you are linking to is in a different directory than the topic you are linking from, you will need to enter the path to the compiled help file in the **File or URL** box. For example, if the help file is located in a directory on the Web, you would need to enter the full URL including the HTTP address, &lt;A HREF="http://www.sample.com/example.chm"&gt;
