# Example: Create a Pop-up Window

Using the HTML Help ActiveX control, you can create a pop-up window that appears when a user clicks a specific word, phrase, or graphic in a topic. This example is based on the [TextPopup](textpopup-method.md) method.

The steps of the process are as follows:

1.  [Write the text for the pop-up window.](to-write-text-for-a-pop-up-window.md)
2.  [Insert the HTML Help ActiveX control in your HTML file.](to-insert-the-html-help-activex-control-in-your-html-file.md)
3.  [Create a hyperlink to open the pop-up window.](to-create-a-hyperlink-to-open-the-pop-up-window.md)

## Notes

-   You can use this example with both uncompiled HTML files and compiled help (.chm) files.
-   This procedure cannot be used to create context-sensitive help topics that users open through an external program.
