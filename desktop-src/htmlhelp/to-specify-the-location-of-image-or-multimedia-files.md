# To specify the location of image or multimedia files

Open an HTML file and add the **&lt;IMG&gt;** tag where appropriate. If you are compiling your files, the HTML Help compiler will automatically add any referenced files to your project at compile time.

> [!Note]  
> The [HTML Help Image Editor](about-the-html-help-image-editor.md), a graphic editing tool that comes with HTML Help Workshop, makes it easy to take screen shots and add them to your help files.
