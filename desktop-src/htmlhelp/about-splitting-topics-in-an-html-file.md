# About Splitting Topics in an HTML File

HTML Help is designed to work with multiple files, each containing a single topic. However, you may find it easier to use a single HTML file that contains a collection of topics. The Split File command (on the Edit menu) inserts an HTML &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag between your help topics, which tells the compiler (Hha.dll) to build each topic as a separate HTML file when you compile your help project.

You can use the **Split File** command to break up topics you have already created in an HTML file, or to [split topics](to-split-topics-in-an-html-file.md) as you author them in a single file.

If you are switching from WinHelp, your source document may be an existing Rich Text Format (.rtf) file, converted to HTML, that contains multiple topics. By splitting the file into separate topics, you can use a single source file to create multiple HTML topic files.
