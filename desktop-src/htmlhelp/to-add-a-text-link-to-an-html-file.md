# To add a text link to an HTML file

-   [Create a text block](to-store-html-tags-or-text-for-later-use.md) for the &lt;A&gt; tag with a destination URL attribute, and then add the tag to your HTML file. For example, create the following text block:
    ```
    <A HREF="file name.htm">link</A>
    ```

    

where `file name` is the name of the file you want the link to jump to and `link` is the text you want a user to click.
