# To add Related Topics links to a file

1.  Open the HTML file you want to add Related Topics links to.
2.  On the **Tags** menu, click **HTML Help ActiveX control**.
3.  In the **Specify the command** box, click **Related Topics**, and then click **Next**.
4.  Follow the instructions on the screen.

## Notes

-   By default, the **Related Topics** list appears in a **Topics Found** dialog box. You can specify that they instead appear on a [pop-up menu](to-have-related-topics-links-appear-on-a-pop-up-menu.md).
-   Related Topics can be authored as a [text link](create-a-text-link-for-html-help-activex-control-commands.md).
-   You can specify that Related Topics [open in a secondary window](to-assign-a-window-type-to-a-topic-when-linking.md).
