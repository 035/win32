# About Screen Capturing

You can use the HTML Help Image Editor to capture three types of windows: program windows, child windows (windows within the program window), or the desktop. To perform the captures you can use keyboard commands, mouse capture, or timed capture.

You can standardize colors for a series of captures to insure consistency in the final output.
