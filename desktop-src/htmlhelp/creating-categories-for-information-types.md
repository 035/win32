# Creating Categories for Information Types

Categories allow you to group information types into easily referenced subject areas. You might, for example, create a category named Experience Level, and then assign the following information types to the category: Novice, Intermediate, and Advanced.

Categories are not required. If you use them, you must assign all information types to a category.
