# Example: Create a Two-Frame HTML Frameset

This example is a five-step process that explains how to create a two-frame HTML frameset designed to appear in a Web browser. It provides instructions for creating a table of contents in the left frame that jumps to topics in the right frame. It also explains when and where to add the HTML Help ActiveX control.

After you have created the example frameset you can add other HTML elements to it to see how it works. You can also change the frameset values or [edit the HTML Help ActiveX control](to-edit-the-html-help-activex-control-in-a-file.md) features.

The five steps of the process are as follows:

1.  [Create a two-frame frameset](to-create-a-two-frame-html-frameset.md).
2.  [Add a navigation frame](to-add-a-navigation-frame.md).
3.  [Add a default frame location to the table of contents file](to-add-a-default-frame-location-to-the-table-of-contents-file.md).
4.  [Add a topic frame](to-add-a-topic-frame.md).
5.  [View the complete frameset in a browser](to-view-the-complete-frameset-in-a-browser.md).

## Notes

-   If you don't want to create your own frameset to display topics you can use the [Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md).
-   To carry out this example, you must already have [a contents (.hhc) file](creating-a-contents-file.md) and a few [HTML topic files](creating-html-files.md) that it links to.
