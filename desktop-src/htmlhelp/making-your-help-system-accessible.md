# Making Your Help System Accessible

Your help system should contain information on how users with disabilities can use your software and your online help. [The accessibility word list](about-the-accessibility-word-list.md) will help you identify some of the most common terms used to refer to disabilities. It can also serve as a checklist for identifying and creating topics about the features in your software program that can help users with disabilities.

Information on developing accessible software, Web site designs, and recommendations on making HTML content more accessible, is also available on the [Microsoft Accessibility and Disabilities Web site](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/default.md).

The HTML Help Viewer contains shortcut keys and other features that make the Help Viewer accessible for users. These features are documented in the [Help Viewer topics](html-help-viewer-topics.md). You can include these topics in your own help system so that your users will also be aware of them.
