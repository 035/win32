# Customize Help

There are many ways you can customize the way your help files appear to the user. You can [customize the Help Viewer](customize-the-help-viewer.md), the three-paned window that help topics automatically appear in, and you can create and [customize secondary windows](create-help-windows.md) to display topics in.
