# Designing Help Windows

The most important part of a help file is the information in it — the words and pictures that the help file contains. But packaging is also important. The way you present words and pictures can play a significant role in making your help file more usable. When designing your help file for distribution with a program, you may want to [create or customize the windows](create-help-windows.md) you use to display your topics.

When designing help windows, keep these options in mind:

-   You can change the type of window in which a topic appears. For example, your home page or an image map might appear in a secondary window while your information topics [appear in the Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md).
-   You can create different windows for different topic types. For example, help for a dialog box might appear in an embedded window while your information topics appear in the Help Viewer.
-   You can change the appearance of a window. For example, you can [change a window's size and position](about-changing-the-size-and-position-of-a-window.md), background colors, [title bar](modify-the-help-viewer.md), [buttons](add-buttons-to-help-windows.md), and other options.
-   You can [create your own frameset](create-a-frameset.md)to display topics.
-   You can ship multiple help files, each with its own set of window definitions.
