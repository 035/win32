# Registering a Web Site with Search Engines

Many people browse the Internet for information by using search engines to locate Web sites. If you are designing a help system for distribution on the Internet, you can register it with the more popular search engines. These include Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Webcrawler, AltaVista, and Infoseek, many of which can be reached if you open Microsoft Internet Explorer, and then click **Search**.

There may also be other search engines commonly used by those in your company, organization, or profession that you can register with. By registering with one or more search engines, you can make your site easier to find and increase traffic to it.

Each search engine has its own requirements for adding a Web site. The home page for each search engine usually has a link to a registration page containing information about how to add your Web site.
