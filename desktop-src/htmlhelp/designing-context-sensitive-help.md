# Designing Context-Sensitive Help

You can [create context-sensitive help](create-context-sensitive-help.md) for many of your program's interface elements. In dialog boxes, users can display help by clicking the question mark in the title bar of a dialog box, and then clicking an item within the dialog box. In Windows, users also can display help by right-clicking an item, clicking **What's This?**, and then clicking an interface element.
