# Creating an Index File

A good index file helps users to locate the information they need. HTML Help Workshop provides the tools needed to create and edit an index file for your help system.

## To create an index file

1.  On the **File** menu, click **New**, and then click **Index**.
2.  [Add keywords](creating-a-keyword.md) to the index (.hhk) file you have created. If you plan to use your index only on a Web site, you can create a [site map index](to-create-an-index-that-uses-a-site-map.md).

## Notes

-   If you are designing a help system using the [Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md), adding an index file to your help project will also create the **Index** tab in the Navigation pane after the project is compiled.
-   If you are designing for a Web site or your own frameset, make sure you [add the HTML Help ActiveX control](inserting-the-html-help-activex-control.md) to the appropriate files and [specify a default frame](to-specify-the-default-frame-in-a-contents-or-index-file.md) to display your index file.
-   If you compile a help file and [set the compatibility to version 1.0](htmlhelp.to_compile_a_project_compatible_with_html_help_version_1.0), a site map index will be created.
