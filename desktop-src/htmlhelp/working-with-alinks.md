# Working with ALinks

Associative Links (ALinks) can be used by a help author to link related topics to each other. When a user clicks a link that is associated with an ALink name, a dialog box or pop-up menu appears that contains a list of the target topics that contain the ALink name. Unlike Keyword Links (KLinks), ALink names do not appear in the index.
