# To set actions to take when single- or double-clicking a contents entry

1.  On the **File** menu, click **Preferences**.
2.  Click the **Contents** tab, and then select the options you want.

> [!Note]  
> These preferences apply to how the contents editor behaves when a help author is using HTML Help Workshop. They do not apply to how the contents function in a compiled help file.
