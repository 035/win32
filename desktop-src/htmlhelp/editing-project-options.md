# Editing Project Options

You create a title for your help file, set which topic will appear by default, and select which items to display when compiling your files in the \[OPTIONS\] section of the project file.

You also use the \[OPTIONS\] section to name the compiled file, log file, and URL root location. And finally, this section indicates which language your file will be in, and which contents and index files will be added to your help project.
