# Example: Create Dynamic Elements with DHTML

Dynamic HTML (DHTML) offers a wide range of possibilities to help you improve the function and appearance of your help system. The following examples explain two dynamic links that are used in the HTML Help documentation, and they provide sample code that will help you to implement similar links in your help system:

-   Add [mouseover](about-creating-dynamic-hyperlinks.md) functionality to all of the hyperlinks in your help system. All it takes is one small addition to your style sheet.
-   Take your links a step further with [dynamic inline elements](about-creating-a-dynamic-inline-element.md).

For more information, see the [HTML and Dynamic HTML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/dhtml_node_entry.asp) reference in the MSDN Library.
