# Distribute Help over the Internet

Help topics distributed over the Internet are usually accessed by users who visit a World Wide Web site. The World Wide Web is a graphical system of moving through the Internet using hyperlinks. All or part of a Web site can contain help topics that a user can view, copy, or download to their computer.

HTML files distributed on the Internet can potentially reach millions of people around the world. Any help topics you publish to the Web should be designed with this in mind. The information in them should be accessible to a wide variety of users.
