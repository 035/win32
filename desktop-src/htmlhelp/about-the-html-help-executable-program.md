# About the HTML Help Executable Program

The HTML Help executable program (Hh.exe) runs whenever a user clicks a compiled help (.chm) file or menu item that opens the help file inside the Help Viewer. The HTML Help executable program calls the HTML Help ActiveX control, which opens the help file and provides navigation and other features to the user.

The program provides these features:

-   Topics appear in the [Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md).
-   [The HTML Help ActiveX control](html-help-activex-control-overview.md) is built into the Help Viewer so that any navigational elements (such as a table of contents, index, or full-text search) specified by the help author will be part of the compiled help file that a user sees.
