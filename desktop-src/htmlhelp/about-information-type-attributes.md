# About Information Type Attributes

An information type can be either Inclusive or Exclusive. If you select the **Inclusive** information type, the user will be allowed to select from one or more information types. If you select **Exclusive**, the user will be allowed to choose only one information type within each category.

### Notes

-   Define all Inclusive information types before you define Exclusive ones.
-   Information types in the same category can't be both Inclusive and Exclusive.
