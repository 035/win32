# Creating a Training Card

Training cards are specialized help topics, to send instructions to, and receive instructions from, a program. They are particularly useful in guiding users through a procedure step-by-step.

1.  Open an HTML file, and then position your cursor at the location where you want to have information sent to or from a program.
2.  Click **HTML Help ActiveX Control**. 

    |                        |                                                                                                                          |
    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-wiz.gif) | Opens the HTML Help ActiveX Control Wizard, which enables you to insert or edit the control in an HTML file. <br/> |

    

     

3.  In the **Specify the command** box, click **Training Card**, and then if you have already used the HTML Help ActiveX control in this file, enter an ID name for this instance of the control.
4.  Work with a developer and the HTML Help API to add the appropriate WM\_TCARD calls for your training card.
