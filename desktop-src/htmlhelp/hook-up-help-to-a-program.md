# Hook Up Help to a Program

HTML Help can be hooked up to your software program in a variety of ways. You can use HTML Help to:

-   Create [context-sensitive help](create-context-sensitive-help.md).
-   Create [training cards](create-training-card-help.md).
-   Use [API calls](about-the-html-help-api-reference.md) to implement help in your program.
