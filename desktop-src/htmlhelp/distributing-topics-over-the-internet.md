# Distributing Topics over the Internet

As you plan your help Web site and author your help topics, you'll want to consider whether you are developing topics for [the Internet](distribute-help-over-the-internet.md) or World Wide Web, for [an intranet](distribute-help-over-an-intranet.md) or private Web site, or for [an extranet](distribute-help-over-a-extranet.md) or commercial Web site with connections to consumer databases.
