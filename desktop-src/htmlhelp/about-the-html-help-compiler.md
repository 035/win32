# About the HTML Help Compiler

The HTML Help compiler (Hha.dll) is part of HTML Help Workshop and is the program that compiles a project (.hhp), contents (.hhc), index (.hhk), topic (.html), and other (.gif, .jpeg, etc.) files into a compiled help (.chm) file.

The compiler provides these features:

-   Source files are compressed into a compiled help file, which uses far less disk space than the original source files.
-   Compiled help files can be distributed along with a software product, or they can be quickly downloaded from a Web site.
-   The HTML Help compiler can also be used [from a command line](to-compile-a-help-project-from-the-dos-prompt.md) without opening HTML Help Workshop.
