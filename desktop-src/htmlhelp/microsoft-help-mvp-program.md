# Microsoft Help MVP Program

The Microsoft Help Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Program is designed to recognize professionals who voluntarily give their expertise to enhance the online experience and technical skills of others.

You can find current members of the MVP Program at the [Microsoft MVP Awardees: Help](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=244624) website.

Past Help MVPs created [MSHelpWiki](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=244625), an online knowledge base, providing rich information about all things related to online Help.

To learn more about Microsoft's MVP Program and how MVPs help, visit the [MVP Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=51623).
