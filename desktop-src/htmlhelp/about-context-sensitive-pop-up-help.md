# About Context-Sensitive Pop-up Help

Help topics for [context-sensitive pop-up help](example--creating-context-sensitive-pop-up-help.md) are text-only. Unlike window help topics, which are HTML files that you include in the \[FILES\] section of your project (.hhp) file, pop-up help topics are stored in a text file that you include in the \[TEXT POPUPS\] section of your project.

Using HTML Help Workshop, help authors can define the basic attributes of a pop-up window. More advanced attributes can be defined by a developer.

For example, in addition to writing code to enable the context-sensitive pop-up topics, a developer can modify the foreground and background colors, font family, font size, and margins of the pop-up topics.

> [!Note]  
> Pop-up windows can also be [used in HTML Help topics](creating-a-pop-up-window.md), to create pop-up glossary definitions, for example.
