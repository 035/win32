# About File Viewing

The HTML Help Image Editor is optimized to load and scroll through multiple images rapidly.

You can specify filters, such as color depth and interlacing, when viewing images to limit what you see in the image. This is useful for testing and debugging image display problems.

You can view images within the desktop, centered on the full screen, tiled on the full screen, or previewed as 16-color images on the full screen. The tiled view is a very handy feature for creating HTML image backgrounds.
