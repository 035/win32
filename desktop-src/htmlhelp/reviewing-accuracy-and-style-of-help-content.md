# Reviewing Accuracy and Style of Help Content

You should test content, images, and other text to make sure that all text is accurate and complete and that it follows editorial guidelines.

## Suggested tasks for testing

-   Test every procedure for accuracy. If you are writing help for a program, make sure all the terminology you use in your topics matches that used in the user interface.
-   Make sure that all topics follow any editorial guidelines you have set up.
-   Access all secondary help text or information attached to your program. Are error messages understandable and easy to read? Is the information provided in dialog boxes accurate and clear?
