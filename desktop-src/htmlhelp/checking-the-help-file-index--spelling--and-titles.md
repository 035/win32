# Checking the Help File Index, Spelling, and Titles

Before you ship your help file, do a final spelling check and make sure that everything works correctly from the Index tab.

## Suggested tasks for testing

-   Run a spelling check on all your HTML files. Use any odd words or phrases that result from this check as an opportunity to expand your index.
-   Scroll through all entries in the Index tab. Make sure the keywords appear correctly and that they jump to the correct topics.
-   Make sure that all topics have a title defined, if necessary.
-   In the index, check for proper indentation of keywords and headings. Because of the way keywords are sorted, you need to make sure that the order of the keywords looks correct and that second-level entries appear under the proper first-level entries.
-   Make sure that keywords jump to the correct topics by double-clicking each one.
-   If you combined or converted keywords from multiple help files, check closely for consistency. You may notice inconsistencies in terminology, use of both singular and plural forms of words, and inconsistent verb construction.
