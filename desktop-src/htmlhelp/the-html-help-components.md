# The HTML Help Components

HTML Help is made up of several components. These include the following:

-   [HTML Help Workshop](about-html-help-workshop.md): a help authoring tool with an easy-to-use graphical interface for creating project files, HTML topic files, contents files, index files, and everything else you need to put together an online help system or Web site.
-   [HTML Help ActiveX control](html-help-activex-control-overview.md): a small, modular program used to insert help navigation and secondary window functionality into an HTML file.
-   [The HTML Help Viewer](using-the-help-viewer-for-topics.md): a fully-functional and customizable three-paned window in which online help topics can appear.
-   [Microsoft HTML Help Image Editor](about-the-html-help-image-editor.md): an online graphics tool for creating screen shots; and for converting, editing, and viewing image files.
-   [The HTML Help Java Applet](about-the-html-help-java-applet.md): a small, Java-based program that can be used instead of an ActiveX control to insert help navigation into an HTML file.
-   [The HTML Help executable program](about-the-html-help-executable-program.md): the program that displays and runs help when you click a compiled help file.
-   [The HTML Help compiler](about-the-html-help-compiler.md): the program that compiles project, contents, index, topic, and other files into a compiled help file.
-   [The HTML Help Authoring Guide](about-the-html-help-authoring-guide.md): an online guide designed to assist help authors in using HTML Help to design a help system. The guide also contains a complete HTML Help reference for developers and an HTML tag reference for authors.

Some of the features of the HTML Help components:

-   [Compressed HTML](file-compression.md): a condensed form of HTML that greatly reduces the amount of disk space required for your help system.
-   [Help project conversion](converting-existing-help-projects.md): a feature that enables you to convert WinHelp projects into HTML Help projects.
