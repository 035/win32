# Authoring Assistance

HTML Help authoring assistance is offered through a set of special features for help authors. These commands are only available if HTML Help Workshop is installed on your computer:

-   **Jump to URL** displays the URL of the currently selected topic, and lets you jump to a URL that you specify. This makes it easy to see what page you are on, or quickly navigate to a specific page.
-   **View Entry** displays information about the currently selected table of contents entry, including the destination file or URL, target frame or window, and any information types associated with the entry.

## Notes

-   In compiled help files, [the Jump to URL and View Entry commands](the-html-help-authoring-commands.md) can be accessed by right-clicking in the toolbar or table of contents of the Help Viewer. The **Jump to URL** command is available on the system menu.
-   In HTML files containing the HTML Help ActiveX control, the **Jump to URL** and **View Entry** commands can only be accessed by right-clicking in the table of contents.
-   The **View Entry** command is not available if you are using a binary table of contents.
