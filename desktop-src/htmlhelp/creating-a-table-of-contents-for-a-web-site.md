# Creating a Table of Contents for a Web Site

Creating a table of contents for use as a navigational aid on a Web site is similar to creating a table of contents for use in a compiled help file. This procedure describes the extra steps you must take to make the table of contents usable over the Web.

## To create a table of contents for a Web site

1.  [Create a table of contents file.](to-create-a-new-contents-file.md)
2.  [Create the HTML file](to-create-a-new-html-file.md) that will contain your table of contents.
3.  Position your cursor at the location where you want the table of contents file to appear, and then click **HTML Help ActiveX Control**. 

    |                        |                                                                                                                          |
    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ![](images/sb-wiz.gif) | Opens the HTML Help ActiveX Control Wizard, which enables you to insert or edit the control in an HTML file. <br/> |

    

     

4.  In the **Specify the command** box, click **Table of Contents**, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

## Notes

-   If your users do not have a browser that supports ActiveX controls, try using the [HTML Help Java Applet](about-the-html-help-java-applet.md).
-   For more information about the **Contents** command, see the [HTML Help ActiveX control reference](contents.md).
