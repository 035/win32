# Clean Up Compiler Messages

You can fix some help file problems before you even open the help file. When you compile a help file, HTML Help Workshop notifies you of some basic problems in the file by reporting compiler messages.

Your first testing task is to [compile the help project](compile-a-help-project.md) and [view the compiler messages](compiler-messages.md). Make sure there are none that can cause problems in your help file.

If you have created context-sensitive help for your program, read the topic on [fixing context-sensitive help problems](troubleshooting-context-sensitive-help.md).
