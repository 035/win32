# Applications that Use Still Image

Two primary types of applications use still digital images. These are:

1.  Applications that edit image data. Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Picture It! consumer photo editing software are examples of this type of application.
2.  Applications that are used to author documents that include image data but cannot edit the image data. Typical applications of this type are word processors such as Microsoft Word, or presentation applications such as PowerPoint.
