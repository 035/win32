# Imaging APIs

Most applications that control image acquisition devices use the TWAIN, ISIS, or Adobe Systems Acquire interfaces. None of these APIs directly support the push model of data acquisition. All are based on the pull model. STI allows the use of these imaging APIs to acquire data. However, applications that use STI may also use the push model of data acquisition.
