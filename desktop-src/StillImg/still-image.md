# Still Image

## Purpose

The Still Image (STI) application programming interface (API) is a standardized interface for acquiring digital still images from devices that are primarily used to capture still images. The Still Image API is the first phase of a standardized interface Microsoft is producing that implements support for still-image acquisition devices.

## Developer audience

The Still Image API is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with the Windows graphical user interface, message-driven architecture, and a working knowledge of color management concepts are required.
