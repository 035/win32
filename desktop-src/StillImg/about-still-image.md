# About Still Image

The Still Image (STI) application programming interface (API) is a standardized interface that acquires digital still images from devices that are primarily used to capture still images. Examples of devices that are accessible through the Still Image API are:



| Device                     | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flatbed scanner            | Scanner with an automatic document feeder, transparency adapter, or other options (such as a "start" button). |
| Sheet-fed scanner          | Scanner with paper-inserted detection mechanism.                                                              |
| Handheld scanner           | Scanner that is moved across the image to be scanned by hand.                                                 |
| Still-image digital camera | Camera with stored images and associated data such as thumbnails and audio.                                   |



 

Currently, support for still-image acquisition devices is provided through individual independent hardware vendor (IHV) solutions. These implementations can vary significantly. The current version of the Still Image API is the first phase of a standardized interface Microsoft produces that implements support for still-image acquisition devices.
