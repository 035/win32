# Asynchronous DCOM

To take advantage of asynchronous RPC transparently, COM programmers can use the Async\* interfaces generated by the MIDL compiler as described in the MIDL attribute topic, [**async\_uuid**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366735). For more information, please see [COM Clients and Servers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683835),[Making and Processing Asynchronous Calls](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692623), and [Asynchronous Method Calls in COM Clients and Servers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/cc301334.aspx).
