# About MADCAP

Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP) enables clients to query and request multicast addresses from multicast (MADCAP) servers. Using this set of client APIs, MADCAP clients can lease, renew, and release multicast addresses from qualifying MADCAP servers across the network.

MADCAP is based on an Internet standard recommendation developed by the Multicast-Address Allocation (MALLOC) Internet Engineering Task Force working group.
