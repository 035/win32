# Eventing

A hosted service must implement the [**IUPnPEventSource**](iupnpeventsource.md) interface if it has evented state variables. This interface has two methods: [**Advise**](iupnpeventsource-advise.md) and [**Unadvise**](iupnpeventsource-unadvise.md). This interface provides a mechanism for the device host to subscribe to event notifications generated by the hosted service. There will be no more than one event sink registered at a time.

A hosted service must implement the [**Advise**](iupnpeventsource-advise.md) method by holding a reference to the [**IUPnPEventSink**](iupnpeventsink.md) interface, which was passed as a parameter. If the interface is found, the **Advise** method holds a reference to that interface until [**Unadvise**](iupnpeventsource-unadvise.md) is invoked, or until the hosted service object is removed. **Advise** is called only once.

To remove the subscription, the device host invokes [**Unadvise**](iupnpeventsource-unadvise.md) and passes in the object pointer used when it called [**Advise**](iupnpeventsource-advise.md). The hosted service removes the subscription if the pointer is the same as the one passed to **Advise**.

When a state variable's value changes, the hosted service must signal that an event has occurred. The services does this by invoking the [**IUPnPEventSink::OnStateChanged**](iupnpeventsink-onstatechanged.md) method.

When the device host no longer needs to receive notifications from the hosted service, it invokes [**IUPnPEventSource::Unadvise**](iupnpeventsource-unadvise.md), passing in the same object pointer that it received from [**Advise**](iupnpeventsource-advise.md). The device host invokes this method when the device is no longer going to be on the network.
