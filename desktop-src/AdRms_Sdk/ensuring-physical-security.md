# Ensuring Physical Security

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

Network security may protect your product against intrusion from hackers, but the computers on which content, code, and certificates are stored can also be accessed internally, tampered with, or even stolen. Structured secure build processes, restricted physical certificate storage, and other physical security measures can help protect your assets.
