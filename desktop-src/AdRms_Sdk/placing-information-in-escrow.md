# Placing Information in Escrow

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

We recommend that you place the following information with a neutral party to ensure its continuity and availability throughout the various stages of product development:

-   Application threat model
-   Documentation of testing scope
-   Test suite
-   Application manifest
-   Product source code
