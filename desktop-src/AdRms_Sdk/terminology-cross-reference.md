# Terminology Cross-Reference

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

There are a number of Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) concepts for which the terminology in current usage varies, depending on whether the concepts are described by developers with access to the code definitions or by deployment and administration personnel. The following table maps the terms as defined in the Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK to the terms used in the Rights Management Services deployment guide.
