# Working with Licenses and Templates

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

Licenses and templates are eXtensible Rights Markup Language (XrML) documents that are used in an Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) infrastructure to specify content use policy. For more information, see [Licenses](licenses.md) and [Templates](templates.md). The following miscellaneous topics discuss general information about these documents in an AD RMS environment.
