# Including Modules in the Application Manifest

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

We recommend that you list in the application manifest all code modules, including third party plug-ins, called by your application. If including all modules is not possible, at least include all modules that handle rights-protected content.
