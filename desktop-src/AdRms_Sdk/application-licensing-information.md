# Application Licensing Information

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

To develop an application by using the Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) SDK, beginning with RMS 1.0 SP2 and Windows Vista, a pre-production certificate is included with the SDK.

To release your application, you must have a production certificate. You can request one by signing a Production License Agreement with Microsoft. The required certificates and license agreements are discussed in the following topics:

-   [Developing an AD RMS Application](developing-an-ad-rms-application.md)
-   [Releasing an AD RMS Application](releasing-an-ad-rms-application.md)
-   [Requesting a Production License Agreement](requesting-a-production-license-agreement.md)
