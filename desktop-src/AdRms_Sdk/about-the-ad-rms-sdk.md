# About the AD RMS SDK

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

The Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) SDK can be used to create applications that enforce terms of use for digital assets. AD RMS consists of a server and a client component. The server component consists of multiple web services that are used for certification and licensing. The client component contains functions and data types that enable the client to encrypt and decrypt content and to interact with an AD RMS server. The following topics provide a broad introduction to Active Directory Rights Management Services and the associated SDK:
