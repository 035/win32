# Requesting a Production License Agreement

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

You must have a production certificate before you can release an application developed by using the Active Directory Rights Management (AD RMS) SDK. You can obtain the certificate by applying for a Production License Agreement. Send an email message to <RMLA@microsoft.com> and include the following information:

-   Full company name
-   Physical corporate address (include the city, state, country or region, and zip or postal code)
-   Corporate mailing address (include the city, state, country or region, and zip or postal code)
-   Company phone and fax numbers
-   Company URL
-   Country or region of incorporation
-   Application or product name
-   First and last name of the requester
-   Title or position of the requester
-   Email address of the requester

Although an email account is not strictly required, the application process typically relies on email for communication. You can get a free email account at Microsoft Outlook.com. If you do not have an account and do not want one, you can send a typewritten application to the following address:<dl> Active Directory Rights Management License Agreements (ADRMLA)  
Microsoft Corporation  
One Microsoft Way  
Redmond, WA 98052-6399  
</dl>

When requesting an agreement, please do the following:

-   Submit the information, in English, as it should appear on the agreement.
-   Send all requested information. Missing or incomplete information can delay processing of your request.

The Active Directory Rights Management Licensing Agreement (ADRMLA) team will respond to your emailed request within three business days, longer if you sent the request by using a postal service. The response will include the license agreement form and further instructions. Read, sign, and return all pages of the agreement to the ADRMLA team. Please do not change the fonts or reformat the paragraphs of the license agreement.

Be sure to follow the instructions you receive from the ADRMLA team. The instructions list the items of digital information needed to fulfill your certificate request. By following the step-by-step instructions you will reduce delays.

The ADRMLA team will forward your production certificate to you after it is created. The certificate is created based on the license agreement and digital information (including a public key) you provide. Please note that it may take up to 15 business days for the ADRMLA team to reply with your certificate by email, longer if communication is by postal service.
