# Creating a Test Plan

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

You should create a test plan early in the development process. The scope and detail of testing should be documented and reviewed by the team, and test cases should be designed by experienced quality-assurance professionals. Testing must achieve the minimum standard specified in the following table:



| Standard level       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum standard     | Before signing a specific build for distribution to end users, it must be tested and must demonstrate that it meets the minimum compliance standards described in [Required Application Security Standards](required-application-security-standards.md). |
| Recommended standard | None at this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Preferred standard   | None at this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
