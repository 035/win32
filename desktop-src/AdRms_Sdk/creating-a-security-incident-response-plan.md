# Creating a Security Incident Response Plan

\[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh535290), which leverages functionality exposed by the client in Msipc.dll.\]

All security systems can eventually fail. Having a security incident response plan in place ahead of time to anticipate and deal with possible failures will aid recovery. You should also include a plan for completing hotfixes in the event of a security breach.

Microsoft requires a security incident response plan prior to releasing a production certificate. You may also want to create a service level agreement (SLA) for your most important customers. An SLA describes how to communicate a security breach and how to perform the work required to execute a hotfix.
