# Boot Configuration Data WMI Provider

## Purpose

The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) WMI provider provides a store that is used to describe boot applications and boot application settings. The objects and elements in the store essentially replace Boot.ini. The data in the store can be managed by using the classes implemented by the WMI provider described in the SDK documentation or by using the BCDEdit command-line tool. For information about using BCDEdit, see [BCDEdit Commands for Boot Environment](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=113151).

## Run-time requirements

The BCD WMI provider requires Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, or later versions of Windows on the system whose boot configuration settings are to be modified. Clients running Windows XP or later can access the WMI provider remotely.
