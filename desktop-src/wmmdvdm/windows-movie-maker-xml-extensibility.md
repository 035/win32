# Windows Movie Maker XML Extensibility

This section of the Windows Movie Maker and Windows DVD Maker SDK details some of the private XML code that defines both the transitions and effects in Windows Movie Maker.

The transitions and effects listed here are divided into categories, such as "shatter transitions" or "blur effects". Within each category, the XML is given for each effect as it is defined in the private XML files for Windows Movie Maker. Then, both customizable and non-customizable parameters are listed and explained.

**Important** XML file parsing in Windows Movie Maker is case sensitive.

**Note** Only select transforms are deconstructed in this way here; for a complete list of the built-in transitions and effects in Windows Movie Maker and the XML that defines them, see [Transition and Effect Objects Provided by Windows Movie Maker](transition-and-effect-objects-provided-by-windows-movie-maker.md).

The following types of transforms are described in this section.
