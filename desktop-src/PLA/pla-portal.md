# Performance Logs and Alerts

## Purpose

Performance Logs and Alerts (PLA) provides application programmers the ability to generate alert notifications based on performance counter thresholds. Programmers can also use PLA to query performance data, create event tracing sessions, capture a computer's configuration, and trace the API calls in some of the Win32 system DLLs.

## Developer audience

PLA is designed for C and C++ developers and those writing scripts.

## Run-time requirements

PLA is available starting with Windows Vista.

For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.
