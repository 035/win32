# Install the SDK

This topic guides you through installing the developer tools.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install the developer tools

1.  Download the [Rights Management Services SDK 2.1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=38397) from the Microsoft Download Center, being careful to choose the correct architecture version for your computer.
2.  Run the installer package from your install location:

    **...\\setup\_sdk.exe**

    The Setup\_sdk.exe file will install both the RMS SDK 2.1 and Rights Management Service Client 2.1.

For more information on the files installed on your system by "setup\_sdk.exe", see [Development environment files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh971321)
