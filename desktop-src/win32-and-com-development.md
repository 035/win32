# Windows desktop apps

This documentation provides info about developing applications and drivers for the Windows operating system. The Win32 and COM application programming interface (API) were designed primarily for development in C and C++, and support development for both 32- and 64-bit Windows. For more info, see these Dev Centers: [Windows Desktop Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/) and [Windows Hardware Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/).

The .NET Framework also provides programming interfaces for developing Windows applications, components, and controls. These programming interfaces can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Visual Basic, C\#, and C++. For more info, see the [.NET Development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/43e22490-fb00-409c-8301-585a03034ae2) documentation.

You can also develop Windows Store apps. For more info, see [Windows Store app development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps).
