# D1148: Invalid Operation On Closed Print Control

Direct2D Print: [**AddPage**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/) or [**Close**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/) is called after [**ID2D1PrintControl**](/windows/desktop/api/D2d1_1/) was closed

## Possible Causes

This message may occur if an application calls ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage on a print control which has been closed. Direct2D considers print control objects to be unchangeable after they are closed, in a similar manner as path geometries and command lists.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application does not attempt to add pages to a closed print control. Modify application logic so that all required pages are sent to a print control before it is closed.
