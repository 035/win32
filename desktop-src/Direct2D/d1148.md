# D1148: Invalid Operation On Closed Print Control

Direct2D Print: [**AddPage**](id2d1printcontrol-addpage.md) or [**Close**](id2d1printcontrol-close.md) is called after [**ID2D1PrintControl**](id2d1printcontrol.md) was closed

## Possible Causes

This message may occur if an application calls ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage on a print control which has been closed. Direct2D considers print control objects to be unchangeable after they are closed, in a similar manner as path geometries and command lists.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application does not attempt to add pages to a closed print control. Modify application logic so that all required pages are sent to a print control before it is closed.
