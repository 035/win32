# D1254: Operation On Single Threaded Domain

A call to [**ID2D1Multithread::Enter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh997714(v=VS.85).aspx) or [**ID2D1Multithread::Leave**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh997716(v=VS.85).aspx) was made on a single-threaded factory domain.

This may occur if the application inadvertently created the D2D factory with [**D2D1\_FACTORY\_TYPE\_MULTI\_THREADED**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/ne-d2d1-d2d1_factory_type). In this case, the call will be ignored.
