# D1254: Operation On Single Threaded Domain

A call to [**ID2D1Multithread::Enter**](/windows/win32/d2d1_1/?branch=master) or [**ID2D1Multithread::Leave**](/windows/win32/d2d1_1/?branch=master) was made on a single-threaded factory domain.

This may occur if the application inadvertently created the D2D factory with [**D2D1\_FACTORY\_TYPE\_MULTI\_THREADED**](/windows/win32/d2d1/ne-d2d1-d2d1_factory_type?branch=master). In this case, the call will be ignored.
