# D1254: Operation On Single Threaded Domain

A call to [**ID2D1Multithread::Enter**](id2d1multithread-enter.md) or [**ID2D1Multithread::Leave**](id2d1multithread-leave.md) was made on a single-threaded factory domain.

This may occur if the application inadvertently created the D2D factory with [**D2D1\_FACTORY\_TYPE\_MULTI\_THREADED**](d2d1-factory-type.md). In this case, the call will be ignored.
