# D1187: SetTarget Called on Outstanding Dc

[**SetTarget**](/windows/win32/D2d1_1/?branch=master) was called in between a [**GetDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master)/[**ReleaseDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) pair.

## Possible Causes

The application obtained an [**ID2D1GdiInteropRenderTarget**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) and called its [**GetDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) method, and then called [**Flush**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) or [**EndDraw**](/windows/win32/D2d1_1/?branch=master) before calling [**ReleaseDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master).

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application calls [**ReleaseDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) before calling [**Flush**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master) or [**EndDraw**](/windows/win32/D2d1_1/?branch=master), and that each call to **ReleaseDC** is matched with a prior call to [**GetDC**](/windows/win32/d2d1/?branch=master). Direct2D will not attempt to operate on a GDI target resource if its GDI device context is currently being used by the application.
