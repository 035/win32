# D1187: SetTarget Called on Outstanding Dc

[**SetTarget**](/windows/desktop/api/D2d1_1/) was called in between a [**GetDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/)/[**ReleaseDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) pair.

## Possible Causes

The application obtained an [**ID2D1GdiInteropRenderTarget**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) and called its [**GetDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) method, and then called [**Flush**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) or [**EndDraw**](/windows/desktop/api/D2d1_1/) before calling [**ReleaseDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/).

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application calls [**ReleaseDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) before calling [**Flush**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/) or [**EndDraw**](/windows/desktop/api/D2d1_1/), and that each call to **ReleaseDC** is matched with a prior call to [**GetDC**](/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/). Direct2D will not attempt to operate on a GDI target resource if its GDI device context is currently being used by the application.
