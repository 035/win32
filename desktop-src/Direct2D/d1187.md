# D1187: SetTarget Called on Outstanding Dc

[**SetTarget**](id2d1devicecontext-settarget.md) was called in between a [**GetDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-getdc.md)/[**ReleaseDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-releasedc.md) pair.

## Possible Causes

The application obtained an [**ID2D1GdiInteropRenderTarget**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget.md) and called its [**GetDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-getdc.md) method, and then called [**Flush**](id2d1rendertarget-flush.md) or [**EndDraw**](id2d1commandsink-enddraw.md) before calling [**ReleaseDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-releasedc.md).

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application calls [**ReleaseDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-releasedc.md) before calling [**Flush**](id2d1rendertarget-flush.md) or [**EndDraw**](id2d1commandsink-enddraw.md), and that each call to **ReleaseDC** is matched with a prior call to [**GetDC**](id2d1gdiinteroprendertarget-getdc.md). Direct2D will not attempt to operate on a GDI target resource if its GDI device context is currently being used by the application.
