# D1147: Print Control Closed Without AddPage

Direct2D Print: Close is called with no previous AddPage calls



|             |       |
|-------------|-------|
| Error Level | Error |



 

## Possible Causes

This message may occur if an [**ID2D1PrintControl**](/windows/win32/D2d1_1/?branch=master) is closed without any prior invocation to [**ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage**](/windows/win32/d2d1_1/?branch=master). Direct2D Print considers a print control with no pages to be erroneous, and the corresponding [**ID2D1PrintControl::Close**](/windows/win32/d2d1_1/?branch=master) command will return an error.

## Possible Fixes

To address the message, add a page to the print control before closing it. If the application need not print any content, refrain from closing the print control, or creating it at all.
