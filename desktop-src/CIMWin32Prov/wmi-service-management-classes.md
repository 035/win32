# WMI Service Management Classes

WMI service management classes are used to manage the WMI service itself and not the computer system or enterprise network. Managing WMI encompasses both configuring the WMI service and managing WMI operations.

The WMI Service Management category includes the following subcategories of classes:

-   [WMI configuration classes](#wmi-configuration-classes)
-   [WMI management classes](#wmi-management-classes)

## WMI Configuration Classes

The WMI Configuration class derives methods that configure the WMI service.

The following is a table of WMI configuration classes.



| Class                                                             | Description                                                                     |

| [**Win32\_MethodParameterClass**](win32-methodparameterclass.md) | Abstract, base class that implements method parameters derived from this class. |
