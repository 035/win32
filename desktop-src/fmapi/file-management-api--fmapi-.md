# File Management API (FMAPI)

The File Management API (FMAPI) provides a way for developers to discover and restore deleted files from unencrypted volumes. FMAPI also provides the ability to use a password or recovery key file for the discovery and recovery of deleted files from Bitlocker encrypted volumes. Recovery of files from other types of encrypted volumes is not supported by FMAPI.

> [!Note]  
> FMAPI can only be used in the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later. Applications that use FMAPI must license WinPE.

 

For information about the FMAPI functions, see [FMAPI Reference](fmapi-reference.md).

In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, FMAPI is included as an optional component in the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238223).

For earlier Windows versions, FMAPI can be downloaded from the following locations:
