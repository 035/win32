# Non-COM-Based DDI Hook-out Functions

## 

Printer IHVs can implement some or all of the non-COM-based DDI hook-out functions listed in this section to provide custom rendering functionality.

Each **OEM***Xxx* render module function listed in this section has the same parameters as its **Drv***Xxx* counterpart, and both functions have the same return values. For these reasons, each reference page in this section directs the reader to the relevant **Drv***Xxx* reference page for detailed information.
