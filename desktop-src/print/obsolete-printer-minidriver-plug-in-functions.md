# Obsolete Printer Minidriver Plug-in Functions

## 

This section consists of obsolete functions that OEMs implemented for Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. Developers writing new printer drivers should not use these functions. Reference pages for these functions are included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation for compatibility reasons only.
