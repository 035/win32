# IPrintOemPS2::WritePrinter method

The `IPrintOemPS2::WritePrinter` method, if supported, enables a rendering plug-in to capture all output data generated by a Postscript driver. If this method is not supported, the output data would otherwise be sent to the spooler in a call to the spooler's **WritePrinter** API (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT WritePrinter(
   PDEVOBJ pdevobj,
   PVOID   pBuf,
   DWORD   cbBuffer,
   PDWORD  pcbWritten
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*pdevobj* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to a [**DEVOBJ**](devobj.md) structure.

</dd> <dt>

*pBuf* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to the first byte of an array of bytes that contains the output data generated by the PostScript driver.

</dd> <dt>

*cbBuffer* 
</dt> <dd>

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the array pointed to by *pBuf*.

</dd> <dt>

*pcbWritten* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to a DWORD value that receives the number of bytes of data that the plug-in sent to the spooler's **WritePrinter** function (described in the Windows SDK documentation).

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

If successful, this method returns S\_OK. Otherwise, this method should return an appropriate value in the returned HRESULT.

## Remarks

At [**DrvEnablePDEV**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**DrvEnablePDEV**) time, the PostScript driver calls this method with *pBuf* and *pdevobj* set to **NULL**, and *cbBuf* set to 0, to detect whether the plug-in implements this function. The plug-in should return S\_OK to indicate it implements this method, and should return E\_NOTIMPL otherwise.

This method should report the number of bytes written to the spooler's **WritePrinter** function in *pcbWritten*. A value of zero carries no special meaning; errors must be reported through the returned HRESULT.
