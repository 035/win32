# Methods for Print Ticket Providers and Consumers

## 

This section provides reference pages for the COM interfaces and their methods that are involved in processing print tickets and printer capabilities.

The **IPrintTicketProvider** interface can be implemented by printer driver developers, including developers of monolithic printer drivers. The **IPrintOemPrintTicketProvider** interface can be implemented by developers who want to provide support for print tickets in Pscript5 and Unidrv plug-ins.
