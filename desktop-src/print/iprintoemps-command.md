# IPrintOemPS::Command method

The `IPrintOemPS::Command` method is used by rendering plug-ins for the Microsoft PostScript printer driver, in order to insert PostScript commands into the print job's data stream.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT Command(
        PDEVOBJ pdevobj,
        DWORD   dwIndex,
        PVOID   pData,
        DWORD   cbSize,
  [out] DWORD   *pdwResult
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*pdevobj* 
</dt> <dd>

Caller-supplied pointer to a [**DEVOBJ**](devobj.md) structure.

</dd> <dt>

*dwIndex* 
</dt> <dd>

Caller-supplied value representing the current injection point within the print job's data stream. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

</dd> <dt>

*pData* 
</dt> <dd>

Not used.

</dd> <dt>

*cbSize* 
</dt> <dd>

Not used.

</dd> <dt>

*pdwResult* \[out\]
</dt> <dd>

Receives a method-supplied value indicating the result of the insertion operation. If the insertion succeeds, this value should be ERROR\_SUCCESS. If the insertion fails, the value should be one of the error codes defined in winerror.h. If the method does not attempt to insert data for a specified *dwIndex* value, the value should be ERROR\_NOT\_SUPPORTED.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

The method must return one of the following values.



| Return code                                                                               | Description                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| <dl> <dt>**S\_OK**</dt> </dl>      | The operation succeeded.<br/>       |
| <dl> <dt>**E\_FAIL**</dt> </dl>    | The operation failed<br/>           |
| <dl> <dt>**E\_NOTIMPL**</dt> </dl> | The method is not implemented.<br/> |



 

## Remarks

The `IPrintOemPS::Command` method is used to insert PostScript commands into the data stream that is generated by the [Microsoft PostScript Printer Driver](print.microsoft_postscript_printer_driver). If you want to provide this method, you must define it in a rendering plug-in.

When the `IPrintOemPS::Command` method is called, its *dwIndex* parameter specifies the current injection point within the print job's data stream. The method should use this value to determine what operation, if any, to perform. Index values, which are defined in wingdi.h, are listed in the following table.

PSINJECT\_DOCUMENTPROCESSCOLORS<br/>

When the printer driver is ready to insert **%%DocumentProcessColors:***color* into the data stream. Data supplied by `IPrintOemPS::Command` replaces the driver's **%%DocumentProcessColors:***color* comment.<br/>

PSINJECT\_DOCUMENTPROCESSCOLORSATEND<br/>

When the printer driver is ready to insert **%%DocumentProcessColors:**(atend) into the data stream. Data supplied by `IPrintOemPS::Command` replaces the driver's **%%DocumentProcessColors:**(atend) comment.<br/>

PSINJECT\_VMRESTORE<br/>

PSINJECT\_VMSAVE<br/>

Before the printer driver sends a **save** command. (See PSINJECT\_VMRESTORE.)<br/>



 

The `IPrintOemPS::Command` method must call [**IPrintOemDriverPS::DrvWriteSpoolBuf**](iprintoemdriverps-drvwritespoolbuf.md) to insert the PostScript commands.

If `IPrintOemPS::Command` methods are exported by multiple rendering plug-ins, the methods are called in the order that the plug-ins are specified for installation, every time that the printer driver reaches an injection point. The following rules apply:

-   If the injection point is one for which supplied data is appended to the data that the printer driver provides, each plug-in is called and each plug-in is allowed to append PostScript commands.

-   If the injection point is one for which supplied data replaces the data that the printer driver provides, the plug-ins are called until one `IPrintOemPS::Command` method supplies ERROR\_SUCCESS for *dwResult*. No other plug-ins are called. If all plug-ins supply ERROR\_NOT\_SUPPORTED, the driver-supplied data is not replaced.

-   If the injection point is one for which supplied data replaces the data that the printer driver provides, and if an application has already replaced the driver-supplied data by using the [POSTSCRIPT\_INJECTION](print.pscript_supported_escapes) printer escape function, no plug-ins are called.
