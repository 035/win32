# Distributing User Interface Components

The COM components, applications and/or files used by a user interface extension can be distributed by creating a Windows Installer package and using a group policy to distribute the package. For more information about creating the Installer package, see [Windows Installer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/cc185688). For more information about group policies, see [Group Policy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa374177).
