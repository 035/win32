# Managing DNS Zones

A DNS zone is a database of RR entries that corresponds to part of the DNS hierarchical name space. DNS zones are used to delineate which DNS Servers are authoritative for resolving name-resolution queries for a given section of the DNS hierarchy.

## Administration Steps

The DNS WMI Provider enables the administration of DNS zones from the authoritative DNS Server itself, or from remote hosts. The general steps necessary to administer a zone using the DNS WMI Provider are:

-   Connecting to the DNS WMI Provider
-   Getting a zone instance
-   Listing or modifying a zone property, or using a method

The following tasks are linked to their associated scripting samples:
