# Managing DNS Zones

A DNS zone is a database of RR entries that corresponds to part of the DNS hierarchical name space. DNS zones are used to delineate which DNS Servers are authoritative for resolving name-resolution queries for a given section of the DNS hierarchy.

## Administration Steps

The DNS WMI Provider enables the administration of DNS zones from the authoritative DNS Server itself, or from remote hosts. The general steps necessary to administer a zone using the DNS WMI Provider are:

-   Connecting to the DNS WMI Provider
-   Getting a zone instance
-   Listing or modifying a zone property, or using a method

The following tasks are linked to their associated scripting samples:

-   [Creating a DNS Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#create-a-dns-zone)
-   [Modifying a DNS Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#modify-a-dns-zone)
-   [Deleting a DNS Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#delete-a-dns-zone)
-   [Adding a Zone IP Address](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#add-a-zone-ip-address)
-   [Deleting a Zone IP Address](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#delete-a-zone-ip-address)
-   [Pausing a Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#pause-a-zone)
-   [Resuming a Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#resume-a-zone)
-   [Updating a Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#update-a-zone)
-   [Reloading a Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#reload-a-zone)
-   [Refreshing a Zone](dns-wmi-provider-samples-managing-dns-zones.md#refresh-a-zone)
