# WinNT Schema

The WinNT schema defines the set of ADSI objects and their class hierarchy for a Windows NT 4.0 network. The [ADSI Objects of WinNT](adsi-objects-of-winnt.md) include User, Computer, Domain, Group, Resource, Session, Service, and others. The [WinNT Object Class Hierarchy](winnt-object-class-hierarchy.md) section that follows discusses the hierarchical relationships among these objects.

Each object implements a set of ADSI interfaces. However, of an implemented interface, not all properties and methods are supported. [WinNT Schema's Mandatory and Optional Properties](winnt-schemaampaposs-mandatory-and-optional-properties.md) lists those properties supported by the WinNT object classes.
