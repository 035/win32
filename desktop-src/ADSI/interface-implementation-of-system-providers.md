# Interface Implementation of System Providers

ADSI incorporates several directory service providers, namely, LDAP and WinNT. Different providers may choose to implement, or not to implement, an interface. Different directory service providers support different properties and methods. For more information about specific directory service provider support, see [ADSI System Providers](adsi-system-providers.md).
