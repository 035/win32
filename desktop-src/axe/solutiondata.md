| [**AssessmentRun**](assessmentrun.md)<br/>                 | Defines the instance of an assessment for execution.<br/> <br/> |
| [**AxeAssessmentManifest**](axeassessmentmanifest.md)<br/> | This is the root node of an assessment manifest.<br/> <br/>     |
| [**Issue**](issue.md)<br/>                                 | This element holds information about a single issue.<br/> <br/> |



## Remarks

Both the **Assessment Object** and **Job Object** provide a property named **SolutionData** of type **SolutionData**.

Also note that there is a **SolutionData** element for the entire job. A solution uses the AXE assessment management object model to add or remove arbitrary, but well formed, XML data to the an assessment instance s **SolutionData** element. The object model will verify that the XML is well formed, but does no other checking. AXE marshals this data into the "report.xml" file for the assessment instance.

This element contains private data generated by the assessment and consumed by a tool that understands the data inside this node. The only requirement for the contents of this node is that it be well formed XML. Source for this element is the assessment.
