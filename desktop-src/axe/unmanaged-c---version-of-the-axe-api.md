# Unmanaged C++ Version of the AXE API

The Assessment Execution Engine (AXE) enables the management and execution of Windows system assessments.

Assessments can help a person understand the state of a system and remedy problems with performance, reliability, or functionality. AXE provides infrastructure needed to manage assessments using a UX tool or script, run assessments, make measurements, process raw data into results, run diagnostics, and publish the results.
