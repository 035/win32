| [Windows Accessibility Features](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373879)<br/> | Describes the Windows system settings and parameters that help make the computer easier to use for people with impairments or disabilities, and explains how to use Windows API elements to programmatically access these settings and parameters.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Windows Automation API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff486375)<br/>          | Describes the Windows APIs that developers can use to make applications running on Windows more accessible to many people with vision, hearing, or motion disabilities. The APIs includes Microsoft Microsoft UI Automation and its predecessor technology, Microsoft Active Accessibility. In addition to accessibility support, UI Automation provides robust support for automated software testing scripts and tools. <br/> |
| [Magnification API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692162)<br/>                             | Describes the Windows API that developers can use to create assistive technology applications that magnify portions of the screen, as well as apply color effects and other transformations.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
