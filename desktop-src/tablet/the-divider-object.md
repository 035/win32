# The Divider Object

Tablet PC Technology includes layout analysis of ink input that combines handwriting and drawing. The [**Divider**](/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut15/) object provides layout analysis features that classify and group strokes into different structural elements.

The [Ink Divider Sample](ink-divider-sample.md) topic demonstrates how to use a [**Divider**](/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut15/) object with [**Ink**](/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/) objects to perform ink layout analysis.

The following sections describe the basic concepts behind the Tablet PC layout analysis technology:
