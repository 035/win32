# The Divider Object

Tablet PC Technology includes layout analysis of ink input that combines handwriting and drawing. The [**Divider**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms696382(v=VS.85).aspx) object provides layout analysis features that classify and group strokes into different structural elements.

The [Ink Divider Sample](ink-divider-sample.md) topic demonstrates how to use a [**Divider**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms696382(v=VS.85).aspx) object with [**Ink**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms704893(v=VS.85).aspx) objects to perform ink layout analysis.
