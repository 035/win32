# WPD\_RESOURCE\_DEFAULT

Specifies the whole file behind the object. It is also a way of referring to any resource type, including those not covered by other Windows Portable Devices resource types, such as a custom object type.

Any resources embedded within the specified resource will be included. For example, the default resource of a root folder of contacts may include all the nested contacts. However, any child resources that are merely *linked* by metadata or references are not included. An example of this would be a playlist, which might only link to audio files through metadata references or textual path references in the file.

The only allowed *pid* value for this **PROPERTYKEY** is zero.

This type of resource must support the following attributes.
