# Transferring an Image or Music File to the Device

One of the most common operations accomplished by an application is the transfer of content to a connected device.

Content transfers are accomplished using the interfaces described in the following table.



| Interface                                                                | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**IPortableDeviceContent Interface**](iportabledevicecontent.md)       | Provides access to the content-specific methods.               |
| [**IPortableDeviceDataStream Interface**](iportabledevicedatastream.md) | Used when writing the content to the device.                   |
| [**IPortableDeviceValues Interface**](iportabledevicevalues.md)         | Used to retrieve properties that describe the content.         |
| IStream Interface                                                        | Used to simplify reading of content and writing to the device. |

The `TransferContentToDevice` function in the sample application's ContentTransfer.cpp module demonstrates how an application could transfer content from a PC to a connected device. In this particular sample, the transferred content can be a file containing an image, music, or contact information.

The first task accomplished by the `TransferContentToDevice` function is to prompt the user to enter an object identifier, which identifies the object to be transferred.


```C++
HRESULT                             hr = S_OK;
WCHAR                               szSelection[81]        = {0};
WCHAR                               szFilePath[MAX_PATH]   = {0};
DWORD                               cbOptimalTransferSize   = 0;
CComPtr<IStream>                    pFileStream;
CComPtr<IPortableDeviceDataStream>  pFinalObjectDataStream;
CComPtr<IPortableDeviceValues>      pFinalObjectProperties;
CComPtr<IPortableDeviceContent>     pContent;
CComPtr<IStream>                    pTempStream;  // Temporary IStream which we use to QI for IPortableDeviceDataStream

// Prompt user to enter an object identifier for the parent object on the device to transfer.
printf("Enter the identifer of the parent object which the file will be transferred under.\n>");
hr = StringCbGetsW(szSelection,sizeof(szSelection));
if (FAILED(hr))
{
    printf("An invalid object identifier was specified, aborting content transfer\n");
}
```



The second task accomplished by the `TransferContentToDevice` function is to create an [**IPortableDeviceContent**](iportabledevicecontent.md) object by calling the [**IPortableDevice::Content**](iportabledevice-content.md) method.


```C++
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    hr = pDevice->Content(&amp;pContent);
    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        printf("! Failed to get IPortableDeviceContent from IPortableDevice, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
    }
}
```



The next task accomplished by the `TransferContentToDevice` function is the creation of a **FileOpen** dialog with which the user can specify the location and name of the file to be transferred.


```C++
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    OPENFILENAME OpenFileNameInfo   = {0};

    OpenFileNameInfo.lStructSize    = sizeof(OPENFILENAME);
    OpenFileNameInfo.hwndOwner      = NULL;
    OpenFileNameInfo.lpstrFile      = szFilePath;
    OpenFileNameInfo.nMaxFile       = ARRAYSIZE(szFilePath);
    OpenFileNameInfo.lpstrFilter    = pszFileTypeFilter;
    OpenFileNameInfo.nFilterIndex   = 1;
    OpenFileNameInfo.Flags          = OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST | OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST;
    OpenFileNameInfo.lpstrDefExt    = pszDefaultFileExtension;

    if (GetOpenFileName(&amp;OpenFileNameInfo) == FALSE)
    {
        printf("The transfer operation was canceled.\n");
        hr = E_ABORT;
    }
}
```



The `TransferContentToDevice` function passes a filter string (`wszFileTypeFilter`) to the GetOpenFileName method, which determines the type of files that the user can choose. Refer to the `DoMenu` function in the WpdApiSample.cpp module for examples of the three different filters allowed by the sample.

After the user identifies a particular file for transfer to the device, the `TransferContentToDevice` function opens that file as an IStream object and retrieves properties that are required to complete the transfer.


```C++
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    // Open the selected file as an IStream.  This will simplify reading the
    // data and writing to the device.
    hr = SHCreateStreamOnFile(szFilePath, STGM_READ, &amp;pFileStream);
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        // Get the required properties needed to properly describe the data being
        // transferred to the device.
        hr = GetRequiredPropertiesForContentType(guidContentType,           // Content type of the data
                                                 szSelection,              // Parent to transfer the data under
                                                 szFilePath,               // Full file path to the data file
                                                 pFileStream,               // Open IStream that contains the data
                                                 &amp;pFinalObjectProperties);  // Returned properties describing the data
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            printf("! Failed to get required properties needed to transfer a file to the device, hr = 0x%lx\n", hr);
        }
    }

    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        printf("! Failed to open file named (%ws) to transfer to device, hr = 0x%lx\n",szFilePath, hr);
    }
}
```



The required properties are retrieved by calling the`GetRequiredPropertiesForContentType` helper-function, which operates on the IStream object. The `GetRequiredPropertiesForContentType` helper-function creates an [**IPortableDeviceValues**](iportabledevicevalues.md) object, retrieves the properties in the following list, and adds them to this object.

-   Parent-object identifier
-   Stream size in bytes
-   Content file name
-   Content name (the file name without the extension)
-   Content type (image, audio, or contact)
-   Content format (JFIF, WMA, or vCard2)

The sample application uses the retrieved properties to create the new content on the device. This is done in three phases:

1.  The application calls [**IPortableDeviceContent::CreateObjectWithPropertiesAndData**](iportabledevicecontent-createobjectwithpropertiesanddata.md) method to create a new IStream object on the device.
2.  The application uses this object to obtain an [**IPortableDeviceDataStream**](iportabledevicedatastream.md) object from the WPD driver.
3.  The application uses the new **IPortableDeviceDataStream** object to write the content to the device (via the StreamCopy helper function). The helper function writes the data from the source file to the stream returned by [**IPortableDeviceContent::CreateObjectWithPropertiesAndData**](iportabledevicecontent-createobjectwithpropertiesanddata.md).
4.  The application completes the operation by calling the Commit method on the destination stream.


```C++
// 4) Transfer for the content to the device
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    hr = pContent->CreateObjectWithPropertiesAndData(pFinalObjectProperties,    // Properties describing the object data
                                                     &amp;pTempStream,              // Returned object data stream (to transfer the data to)
                                                     &amp;cbOptimalTransferSize,    // Returned optimal buffer size to use during transfer
                                                     NULL);

    // Once we have a the IStream returned from CreateObjectWithPropertiesAndData,
    // QI for IPortableDeviceDataStream so we can use the additional methods
    // to get more information about the object (i.e. The newly created object
    // identifier on the device)
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        hr = pTempStream->QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;pFinalObjectDataStream));
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            printf("! Failed to QueryInterface for IPortableDeviceDataStream, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
        }
    }

    // Since we have IStream-compatible interfaces, call our helper function
    // that copies the contents of a source stream into a destination stream.
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        DWORD cbTotalBytesWritten = 0;

        hr = StreamCopy(pFinalObjectDataStream, // Destination (The Object to transfer to)
                        pFileStream,            // Source (The File data to transfer from)
                        cbOptimalTransferSize,  // The driver specified optimal transfer buffer size
                        &amp;cbTotalBytesWritten);  // The total number of bytes transferred from file to the device
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            printf("! Failed to transfer object to device, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        printf("! Failed to get IStream (representing destination object data on the device) from IPortableDeviceContent, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
    }

    // After transferring content to the device, the client is responsible for letting the
    // driver know that the transfer is complete by calling the Commit() method
    // on the IPortableDeviceDataStream interface.
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        hr = pFinalObjectDataStream->Commit(0);
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            printf("! Failed to commit object to device, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
        }
    }

    // Some clients may want to know the object identifier of the newly created
    // object.  This is done by calling GetObjectID() method on the
    // IPortableDeviceDataStream interface.
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        PWSTR pszNewlyCreatedObject = NULL;
        hr = pFinalObjectDataStream->GetObjectID(&amp;pszNewlyCreatedObject);
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
            printf("The file '%ws' was transferred to the device.\nThe newly created object's ID is '%ws'\n",szFilePath ,pszNewlyCreatedObject);
        }

        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            printf("! Failed to get the newly transferred object's identifier from the device, hr = 0x%lx\n",hr);
        }

        // Free the object identifier string returned from the GetObjectID() method.
        CoTaskMemFree(pszNewlyCreatedObject);
        pszNewlyCreatedObject = NULL;
    }
}
