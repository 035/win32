## High Dynamic Range (HDR) Detection

The following API's have been added in order to detect HDR displays:

-   [**IDXGIAdapter4**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_6/nn-dxgi1_6-idxgiadapter4)
-   [**IDXGIOutput6**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_6/nn-dxgi1_6-idxgioutput6)

Additional fields in [**DXGI\_ADAPTER\_FLAG3**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/3CD83EEB-2F13-4B32-9E27-CF8456FB3E39) and [**DXGI\_COLOR\_SPACE\_TYPE**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgicommon/ne-dxgicommon-dxgi_color_space_type) have been added to support these APIs.
