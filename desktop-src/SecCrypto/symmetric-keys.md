# Symmetric Keys

A [*Symmetric key*](security.s_gly#-security-symmetric-key-gly) is a single key that is used with the operations of a [*symmetric encryption*](security.s_gly#-security-symmetric-encryption-gly) scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known [*public key algorithms*](security.p_gly#-security-public-key-algorithm-gly). Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are [*RC4*](security.r_gly#-security-rc4-gly), Triple DES ([*Data Encryption Standard*](security.d_gly#-security-data-encryption-standard-gly)), and [*Advanced Encryption Standard*](security.a_gly#-security-aes-gly) (AES).

Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.
