Description: A Symmetric key is a single key that is used with the operations of a symmetric encryption scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

# Symmetric Keys

A [*Symmetric key*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*Symmetric key*) is a single key that is used with the operations of a [*symmetric encryption*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*symmetric encryption*) scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known [*public key algorithms*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*public key algorithms*). Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are [*RC4*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*RC4*), Triple DES ([*Data Encryption Standard*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*Data Encryption Standard*)), and [*Advanced Encryption Standard*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*Advanced Encryption Standard*) (AES).

Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.
