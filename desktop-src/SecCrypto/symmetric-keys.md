Description: A Symmetric key is a single key that is used with the operations of a symmetric encryption scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

# Symmetric Keys

A [*Symmetric key*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50) is a single key that is used with the operations of a [*symmetric encryption*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50) scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known [*public key algorithms*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fe6cfd3-8a2e-4dbe-9fb8-332633daa97a). Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are [*RC4*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce589e18-02ac-42c2-b76b-776deb686bbd), Triple DES ([*Data Encryption Standard*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/d007cbb9-b547-4dc7-bc22-b526f650f7c2)), and [*Advanced Encryption Standard*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/0baaa937-f635-4500-8dcd-9dbbd6f4cd02) (AES).

Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.
