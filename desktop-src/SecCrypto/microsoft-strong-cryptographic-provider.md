# Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider

The Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider is used as the default RSA Full [*cryptographic service provider*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*cryptographic service provider*) (CSP). It supports all of the algorithms of the Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider and all of the same [*key lengths*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*key lengths*). For information about default key lengths and algorithms, see Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider. For information about longer key lengths and available algorithms, see the table with [Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider](microsoft-enhanced-cryptographic-provider.md).
