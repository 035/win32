# Requests

Certificate Services supports [*certificate requests*](security.c_gly#-security-certificate-request-gly) based on the PKCS \#10 format and the Keygen (Netscape) format. Certificate Services also supports PKCS \#7 renewal requests and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) requests.

Certificate Services also provides an [ICertRequest](icertrequest.md) interface, which contains methods for submitting a certificate request and (if the request is approved) for receiving the resulting issued certificate.

Additional security-related interfaces are available in the [Certificate Enrollment Control](certificate-enrollment-control.md).
