# Hardware Cryptography

Certificate Services supports hardware-related cryptography, such as issuing certificates stored on [*smart cards*](security.s_gly#-security-smart-card-gly). The enterprise [*certification authority*](security.c_gly#-security-certification-authority-gly) (CA) supports the issuance of smart card certificates for domain logon on the operating system. Additionally, both the enterprise CA and stand-alone CA support issuance of other types of smart card certificates.

For details, see the product documentation. For developer information about smart cards, see [Smart Card Authentication](security.smart_card_authentication). For information about the control that allows an administrator to request smart card certificates on behalf of users, see [Smart Card Enrollment Control](secsmart.smart_card_enrollment_control_usage_scenario).
