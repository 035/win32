# Hardware Cryptography

Certificate Services supports hardware-related cryptography, such as issuing certificates stored on [*smart cards*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50). The enterprise [*certification authority*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/db46def4-bfdc-4801-a57d-d568e94a2dbb) (CA) supports the issuance of smart card certificates for domain logon on the operating system. Additionally, both the enterprise CA and stand-alone CA support issuance of other types of smart card certificates.

For details, see the product documentation. For developer information about smart cards, see [Smart Card Authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/cb5c80ea-c15e-4f68-a94b-b458d69ff474). For information about the control that allows an administrator to request smart card certificates on behalf of users, see [Smart Card Enrollment Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d9a36e3-76fd-4226-bc39-405b7c13a115).
