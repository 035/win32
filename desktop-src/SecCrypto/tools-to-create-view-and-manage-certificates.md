All user input to these tools is case insensitive. Separate options now exist for the [*key pair*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*key pair*) name and the [*private key*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*private key*) file.

## Additional Tools

Certutil.exe is a command-line tool that is installed as part of Certificate Services. You can use Certutil.exe to dump and display [*certification authority*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*certification authority*) (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, back up and restore CA components, and verify [*certificates*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*certificates*), [*key pairs*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*key pairs*), and certificate chains. For more information about Certutil, see the [Certutil](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=120697) topic on Microsoft TechNet.
