# Cryptography, CryptoAPI, and CAPICOM

CryptoAPI and CAPICOM provide services that enable application developers to add encryption/decryption of data, authentication using digital [*certificates*](security.c_gly#-security-certificate-gly), and encoding to and decoding from [*Abstract Syntax Notation One*](security.a_gly#-security-abstract-syntax-notation-one-gly) (ASN.1) to their Windows-based applications. Application developers can use the functions in CryptoAPI without knowing details of the underlying implementation, in much the same way as they can use a graphics library without knowing anything about the particular graphics hardware configuration. CryptoAPI works with a number of [Cryptographic Service Providers](microsoft-cryptographic-service-providers.md) that perform the actual cryptographic functions.
