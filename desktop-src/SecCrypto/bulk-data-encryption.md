# Bulk Data Encryption

A [*bulk encryption key*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*bulk encryption key*) is generated by [*hashing*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*hashing*) one of the MAC keys using [**CryptHashSessionKey**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-crypthashsessionkey) together with the message contents and other data. The message is encrypted/decrypted with one of the bulk encryption keys in the usual manner.

When using a [*block cipher*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*block cipher*), the [*Schannel*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*Schannel*) protocol engine does all necessary *block cipher* [*padding*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*padding*). When [**CryptEncrypt**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptencrypt) and [**CryptDecrypt**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecrypt) are called, the Final flag is always **FALSE** and the data length is a multiple of whole block lengths.

> [!Note]  
> The CSP must never buffer data internally. After the data has been encrypted (or decrypted), the size of the [*plaintext*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*plaintext*) must always exactly match the size of the [*ciphertext*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*ciphertext*).
