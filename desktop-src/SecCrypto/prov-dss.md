# PROV\_DSS

The PROV\_DSS provider type, like PROV\_RSA\_SIG, only supports [*hashes*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*hashes*) and [*digital signatures*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*digital signatures*). The signature algorithm specified by the PROV\_DSS provider type is the [*Digital Signature Algorithm*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*Digital Signature Algorithm*) (DSA).

## Algorithms Supported
