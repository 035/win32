# IrDA as a Foolproof Non-cable

Mismatched connectors and wiring are impossible with IrDA. Speed and configuration parameters are transparently negotiated at connect time, and a common set is used for the connection. IrDA at 4 Mbps is compatible with 9.6 Kbps IrDA. Additionally, the IrDA connector is completely sealed, inexpensive, and available from multiple vendors.
