# Serial IrDA (SIR) Physical Layer

The SIR specification defines a short-range infrared asynchronous serial transmission mode with one start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. The maximum data rate is 115.2 Kbps (half duplex). The primary benefit of this specification is that existing serial hardware can be used inexpensively, which has contributed to the widespread availability of IrDA.
