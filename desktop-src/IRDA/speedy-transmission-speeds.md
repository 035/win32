# Speedy Transmission Speeds

IrDA is designed to support transmission of data between two devices over short-range point-to-point infrared at speeds between 2.4 Kbps and 16 Mbps.

[SIR](serial-irda-sir-physical-layer.md) (115 Kbps) and [FIR](fast-irda-fir-physical-layer.md) (4 Mbps) IrDA hardware can easily be added to a desktop computer by attaching a [*dongle*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*dongle*) to a serial port (SIR) or by adding a card and a dongle (FIR).

In Windows XP, support is included for USB-attached and [VFIR](very-fast-irda-vfir-physical-layer.md) (16 Mbps) IrDA devices.
