# IrDA Programming with Windows Sockets

The recommended approach to programming IrDA applications is through the Windows Sockets API. Earlier versions of Microsoft Windows used the serialized IrCOMM programming method, which is not supported in Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, or Windows 2000, nor is it the recommended approach. Be aware that an IrCOMM kernel-mode driver is provided in Windows XP and Windows 2000 to facilitate IrDA-enabled mobile phones using PC-initiated IrCOMM connections.

The various Windows operating systems that support IrDA have specific requirements for programming IrDA applications.
