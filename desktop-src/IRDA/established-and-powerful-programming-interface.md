# Established and Powerful Programming Interface

The combination of IrDA and Windows Sockets provides a powerful programming interface that exposes multiple, fully error-corrected data streams. Serial and parallel ports are the only other point-to-point technologies that have a commonly available programming interface, but IrDA defines rich functionality that exists without serial and parallel cables. IrDA borrows from the successful client/server connection and programming model defined by the TCP/IP family of protocols and Windows Sockets.
