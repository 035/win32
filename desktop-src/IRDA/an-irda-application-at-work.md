# An IrDA Application at Work

The following scenario illustrates some of the unique features of IrDA:

Two notebook computers are placed side-by-side. A computer icon appears on both desktops, the name of the peer computer below it. You open the icon and a folder showing the contents of the peer computer desktop appears.

To move data between the computers, drag-and-drop between your desktop and the open folder (showing the peer computer desktop). You implemented this walk-up functionality by selecting a check box.

In addition to using this type of connectivity, several similar applications could be running simultaneously.

An application using such connectivity could run on existing notebook computers at transfer speeds of up to 16 Mbps. Instances of the application, regardless of the bandwidth of the underlying hardware, would work with all other instances at a common fastest speed.

To expose more functionality, you could replace one of the connected notebook computers with another device, such as a digital camera, a handheld personal computer, a printer, a data capture device, or an electronic commerce device.

All of this functionality — seamless access between devices, without any cable connecting them; just a port on the connected devices — is possible today with IrDA under Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, and Windows CE. The underlying technology is based on inexpensive, widely available, short-range infrared transceivers that adhere to Infrared Data Association (IrDA) standards.
