# IrDA Core Protocols and Services

IrDA on Windows provides core services similar to those exposed by Transmission Control Protocol (the TCP part of TCP/IP). Like TCP, applications on different devices can open multiple, reliable IrDA connections to send and receive data. Client IrDA applications connect to a server application by specifying a device address (similar to a TCP host IP address), and further specify their connection using an application address (similar to a TCP port).

The protocols and services exposed by IrDA are explained in the following sections. For more information about how these services fit into the Windows implementation of IrDA, see [Windows IrDA Architecture](windows-irda-architecture.md).
