# IrCOMM

IrCOMM is a family of protocols that runs on top of the core IrDA–protocol suite. IrCOMM supports the emulation of a peer device connected by a serial or parallel cable, for applications that access serial and parallel ports through the operating system API.

Since various communication and printing applications use cables differently, cable emulation must take those differences into account. The IrCOMM specification addresses this by providing four different service types, or classes:

-   3-wire raw
-   3-wire cooked
-   9-wire cooked
-   Centronics

For more details please see the "IrCOMM: Serial and Parallel Port Emulation over IR (Wire Replacement)" specification at [www.irda.org](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84072).
