# Infrared Data Association

## Purpose

Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is a protocol suite designed to provide wireless, line-of-sight connectivity between devices. IrDA, as available on Microsoft Windows, provides core services similar to those exposed by Transmission Control Protocol (the TCP part of TCP/IP). Like TCP, applications on different devices can open multiple, reliable IrDA connections to send and receive data. IrDA is also an organization that creates, promotes, and standardizes IrDA technology. For more information, see [www.irda.org](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84072).

## Where applicable

IrDA is ideally suited for wireless networking. IrDA and Windows Sockets work together to support the implementation of easy-to-use, zero-configuration, point-to-point networking.

## Developer audience

IrDA is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with Windows Sockets and Windows networking technology is required.

## Run-time requirements

Microsoft provides support for IrDA on Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows Me/98/95, and Windows CE.
