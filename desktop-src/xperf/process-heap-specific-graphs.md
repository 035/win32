# Process Heap Specific Graphs

When the " -heap" and the "-stackwalk HeapAlloc+ReAlloc" options are used, four graphs and summary tables relevant to heap analysis are generated:

-   [Heap Outstanding Allocation Size](heap-outstanding-allocation-size.md)

-   [Heap Outstanding Allocation Count](heap-outstanding-allocation-count.md)

-   [Heap Total Allocation Size](heap-total-allocation-size.md)

-   [Heap Total Allocation Count](heap-total-allocation-count.md)

> [!Note]The [Heap Extents](heap-extents.md) graph is dealt with in the [Advanced Topics](advanced-topics.md) section of this document.
>
> For complete information on using these graphs to analyze Process Heaps please see [Graph Guidelines](graph-analysis-guidelines.md).
