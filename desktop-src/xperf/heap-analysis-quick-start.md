# Heap Analysis Quick Start

The following is a brief example of using Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) to identify heap allocations and de-allocations. This exercise will walk the user through WPA heap analysis using sidebar.exe as an example to view graphs and a summary table.

This example is not a complete review of WPA function or heap analysis. It is meant to give the first time user of WPA a high level overview of the product and some of the function provided using the Process Heap Analysis features. For a complete review of WPA see the [Detailed Walkthrough](detailed-walkthrough.md) section of this document . For more complete information on heap analysis, see the [Analyzing Process Heap Data](analyzing-process-heap-data.md) section of this document.
