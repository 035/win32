# Opening a Summary Table

-   Open the context menu on the graph that will provide the summary table data by right clicking.

-   If Load Symbols is not selected, select it now.

-   Select Summary Table.

The Type column of a summary table identifies where allocations are made within the selected time interval. The Type column indicates the lifetime of the allocations relative to the selected time interval. Every individual allocation is represented by one of the 4 Type values:

-   AIFI - Allocated Inside Freed Inside

-   AIFO - Allocated Inside Freed Outside

-   AOFI - Allocated Outside Freed Inside

-   AOFO - Allocated Outside Freed Outside

In most cases, AIFI allocations are transient, and AIFO are outstanding.
