# Sample Analyzer Graphs

This section displays and explains a set of useful graphs that would typically be used in an initial performance analysis. Standard WPA syntax was used to collect trace data. For more information on WPA syntax please see [Starting a Trace](starting-a-trace.md) and [Stopping a Trace](stopping-a-trace.md).

> [!Note]  
> In earlier versions of WPA the command **Xperfview** *filename***.etl** is used to open the graph viewer. Currently either **xperf** or **xperfview** can be used interchangeably to open the graph viewer.
