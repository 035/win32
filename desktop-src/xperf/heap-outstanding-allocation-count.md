-   The steepness of the line slopes are indications of an increase in the number of allocations.

-   Allocations that have short lifetimes are displayed by ripples on the graph plots.

-   Frequent ripples indicate variances in the number of allocations. Plots having frequent ripples are indicative of transient allocations.
