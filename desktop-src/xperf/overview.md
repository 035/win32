# Overview

A trace profile is a collection of various settings of a specific type of trace. You can gather and control these settings with a single command per operation. Basically, there are two types of profiles, memory-based and file-based profiles. Depending on which mechanism you plan to use for tracing, writing to a buffer in memory, or writing to file, you can select a the appropriate profile.
