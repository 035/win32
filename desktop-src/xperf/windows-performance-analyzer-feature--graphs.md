# Windows Performance Analyzer Feature: Graphs

Graphs display event data captured using Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) in a convenient, visually oriented fashion. The number and type of graphs available for a trace session is based on the events captured during the trace. Traces from disparate areas of the system can be overlaid to produce a comprehensive set of visual models. WPA will automatically collate the data collected and format that data for presentation. For information on gathering data please see [Quick Start](quick-start.md).

After a set of graphs is built by WPA, individual graphs in that set are highly configurable. The analyst can easily select a time interval and specific information, down to the thread level, to be analyzed. Multiple graphs can be consolidated into a single graph presenting a unified view of system behaviors.
