# Lost Buffers

In certain cases event collection activities can exceed the capacity of the system to write to the log file. Lost events can lead to analysis difficulties or erroneous conclusions because of incomplete data. If this situation occurs, a message box will display when Xperfviewer is started warning the user of lost buffers and events. For a complete discussion on managing lost buffers please see [Avoiding Lost Buffers](avoiding-lost-buffers.md) in the [Appendix](appendix.md) of this document.
