# Preparing the Spin Lock Event Collection Environment

Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) Spin Lock analysis is implemented on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 environments. Spin Lock analysis is not currently available on other architectures.

If you are not familiar with WPA, please review the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) section of this document.

For information on WPA installation requirements and procedures please see the [System Requirements](system-requirements.md) and [Installation](installation.md) sections of this document.

In order to perform meaningful analysis, familiarity with WPA symbols is recommended. For information on symbols please see [Symbol Support](symbol-support.md).
