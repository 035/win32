# CPU Power Management

This document provides an overview on the use of Windows Performance Analyzer to collect information pertaining to CPU power states. The intent is not to provide an exhaustive study of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) or the current state of other industry power saving initiatives. Rather, we will explore the use of Windows Performance Analyzer as an aid to understand power consumption in specific scenarios.
