# Analyzing Process Heap Data

Windows Performance Analyzer provides three powerful tools to assist in interpreting and analyzing process heap events.

-   *Graphs* are data visualization tools that present process heap data in graphic format.

-   *Summary Tables* provide call stack and frame data in customizable formats. Using summary tables and the "-stackwalk" options, analysts can drill down to the individual stack frame where allocation calls are made.

-   *Actions* are components that process traces and produce text reports. Actions are designed to produce summaries that are specific to specific set of events. These summaries can be produced in a number of formats including .txt, .csv and .xml.

In the following analysis example, the trace file generated in the [Quick Start](heap-analysis-quick-start.md) section of this document will be the basis for the analysis. If you have not yet completed the QuickStart exercise, please see [Quick Start - Capturing Process Heap Information](quick-start---capturing-process-heap-information.md).

For general help on starting and stopping WPA trace sessions please see [Starting a Trace](starting-a-trace.md) and [Stopping a Trace](stopping-a-trace.md).
