# Introduction: Intro to WPA

Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) is a set of performance monitoring tools used to produce in-depth performance profiles of Microsoft Windows operating systems and applications. WPA is useful to a broad audience including:

-   System builders

-   Hardware manufacturers

-   Driver developers

-   General application developers

WPA has been engineered specifically for measuring and monitoring system and application performance on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and later Microsoft operating systems. Limited function is provided for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003. For further information regarding Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 see the [Installation](installation.md) section of this document.
