# Opening Heap Graphs

When the name of a trace file is passed to the xperf program from the command line, the WPA viewer is opened. For example:


```
xperf myfile.etl
```



The WPA viewer produces graphs and summary tables by collating the data in the trace or "etl" file. The content of the graphs and summary tables is driven by the options used to create the trace file. For more information on WPA options and flags please see [WPA:Detailed Walkthrough](detailed-walkthrough.md).
