# Components of NetShell

Some components in NetShell must be defined before a clear understanding of the process for creating a NetShell context can be obtained. This topic provides developers with information about creating NetShell contexts.

NetShell components include:

-   [NetShell Root Context](netshell-root-context.md)
-   [NetShell Helpers](netshell-helpers.md)
-   [NetShell and Command Inheritance](netshell-and-command-inheritance.md)
-   [NetShell and Command Abbreviation](netshell-and-command-abbreviation.md)
-   [NetShell and Offline Mode](netshell-and-offline-mode.md)

For more information about how to use NetShell to administer networking services in Windows XP, see Online Help or the Windows XP Resource Kit.
