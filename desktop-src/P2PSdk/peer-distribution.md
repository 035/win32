# Peer Distribution

The Peer Distribution API, which supports the Branch Cache feature in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, offers a set of platform APIs that can increase network responsiveness of centralized applications when accessed from remote offices, giving users in those offices the experience of working on your local area network. The capabilities offered by this set of APIs can also help in reducing overall wide area network (WAN) utilization.

Implementing these features does not require any pre-existing infrastructure. Making improvements to the performance of remote networks is accomplished simply by deploying Windows 7 to client computers, deploying Windows Server 2008 R2 to server computers, and enabling the Branch Cache feature.

The Peer Distribution APIs work seamlessly alongside network security technologies, including SSL, SMB Signing, and end-to-end IPsec. You can use this API to reduce network bandwidth utilization and improve application performance even if the content is encrypted.
