This version of Direct3D is faster and more efficient than any previous version. Direct3D 12 enables richer scenes, more objects, more complex effects, and full utilization of modern GPU hardware. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| [Understanding Direct3D 12](directx-12-getting-started.md)<br/>                                      | To write 3D games and apps for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile, you must understand the basics of the Direct3D 12 technology, and how to prepare to use it in your games and apps.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Work Submission in Direct3D 12](command-queues-and-command-lists.md)<br/>                           | To improve the CPU efficiency of Direct3D apps, Direct3D 12 no longer supports an immediate context associated with a device. Instead, apps record and then submit *command lists*, which contain drawing and resource management calls. These command lists can be submitted from multiple threads to one or more command queues, which manage the execution of the commands. This fundamental change increases single-threaded efficiency by allowing apps to pre-compute rendering work for later re-use, and it takes advantage of multi-core systems by spreading rendering work across multiple threads. <br/> |
| [Resource Binding in Direct3D 12](resource-binding.md)<br/>                                          | Binding is the process of linking resource objects to the shaders of the graphics pipeline. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
