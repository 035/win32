# Window Stations and Desktops

Windows provides three main categories of objects: user interface, graphics device interface (GDI), and kernel. [Kernel objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724485) are securable, while [user objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms725486) and [GDI objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724291) are not. Therefore, to provide additional security, user interface objects are managed using window stations and desktops, which themselves are securable objects.
