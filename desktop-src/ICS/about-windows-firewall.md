# About Windows Firewall for Windows XP with SP2

Through the Windows Firewall API, you can allow applications to enumerate connections, enable or disable Windows Firewall, and configure port openings.

> [!Note]  
> For Windows Vista and later, use of the [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](windows-firewall-advanced-security-start-page.md) API is recommended.

 

**Note**  All users may read the configuration settings. However, Administrator privileges are required to change Windows Firewall configuration settings.

Windows Firewall cannot be enabled on IrDA or a Direct Cable Connect (DCC) connection.

For information on the individual Windows Firewall API elements, see the following section:
