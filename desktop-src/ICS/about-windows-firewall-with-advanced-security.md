# About Windows Firewall with Advanced Security

The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security API allows the creation of extremely specific firewall rules. Through the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security API, you can allow applications to enumerate connections, enable or disable Windows Firewall, and configure port openings.

**Note**  All users may read the configuration settings. However, Administrator privileges are required to change Windows Firewall with Advanced Security configuration settings.

Windows Firewall with Advanced Security cannot be enabled on IrDA or a Direct Cable Connect (DCC) connection.

For guidance on how to use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, see [Windows Firewall Integration and Best Practices](windows-firewall-integration-and-best-practices.md).

Information on the individual Windows Firewall with Advanced Security API elements is available in the [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Reference](windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-reference.md) section.
