# Windows Firewall Technologies

## Purpose

Windows Firewall with Advanced Security and the related firewall technologies documented here enable developers to share Internet connections, protect connections using a firewall, and provide Network Address Translation (NAT).

Microsoft has released several versions of the firewall product, each building on the previous technology. The current release, [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](windows-firewall-advanced-security-start-page.md), allows the creation of extremely specific firewall rules.

The specific technologies are as follows (listed here from newest to oldest):

-   [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](windows-firewall-advanced-security-start-page.md) is the most recent version. It was first released with Windows Vista.
-   [Windows Firewall](windows-firewall-start-page.md) was first released as a component of Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2).
-   [IPv6 Internet Connection Firewall](ipv6-icf-start-page.md) was released as a component of the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP. It is unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.
-   [Internet Connection Sharing and Internet Connection Firewall](ics-and-icf-start-page.md) was first released in Windows XP and is supported in Windows Vista. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.

## Developer audience
