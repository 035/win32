## Developer audience

Network Access Protection (NAP) is a set of operating system components that provide a platform for protected access to private networks. The NAP platform provides an integrated way of evaluating the system health state of a network client that is attempting to connect to or communicate on a network and restricting the access of the network client until health policy requirements have been met. The Network Access Protection WMI Provider is designed for use by applications that work with NAP.
