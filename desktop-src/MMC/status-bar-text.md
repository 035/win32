# Status Bar Text

This feature is introduced in MMC version 1.1.

MMC enables a snap-in to change the text in the status bar of each MDI child window (view).

In MMC 1.1 and later, each view has a status bar. In addition, the Status Bar menu item is added to the **View** menu of each child window and its context menu.

The [**IConsole2::SetStatusText**](iconsole2-setstatustext.md) method enables a snap-in to change the text in the status bar.
