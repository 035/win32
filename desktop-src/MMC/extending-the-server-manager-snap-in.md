# Extending the Server Manager Snap-in

In Windows Server 2008 the new Server Manager snap-in replaces the Computer Management snap-in in many contexts. For example, when you click **Start**, right-click **Computer** and select **Manage**, the Server Manager snap-in appears. It provides a superset of the previous Computer Management snap-in functionality. The Server Manager snap-in contains extensible nodes that extension snap-ins can register against.

For more information about node types that are extensible in the Server Manager snap-in, please see [Server Manager Extensible Node Types](server-manager-extensible-node-types.md).

For more information about clipboard formats supported by the Server Manager snap-in, see [Server Manager Clipboard Formats](server-manager-clipboard-formats.md).
