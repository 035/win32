# MMC Taskpads

There are two types of taskpads: *snap-in taskpads* and *console taskpads*. Snap-in taskpads were introduced in MMC 1.1 and have been largely replaced by console taskpads in MMC 1.2. Console taskpads offer many advantages: ease of creation, performance, display consistency, and ability of the user to customize the taskpad. In MMC 1.2, there is little reason for choosing snap-in taskpads over console taskpads.
