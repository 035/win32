# Getting Started with the Automation Object Model

Microsoft Management Console (MMC) 2.0 contains the first release of the MMC automation object model architecture for snap-in and extension developers. The MMC 2.0 automation object model can be used by developers who do not want to write snap-ins or extensions, but would rather write programs that interact with MMC.

In addition to supporting C/C++ and Visual Basic, the MMC 2.0 automation objects are accessible from any macro language or programming tool that implements [Automation](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=83929).

The following topics provide information about using the MMC 2.0 automation object model.
