When the user selects or expands the static node in the scope pane, the snap-in associated with the static node is notified and can insert enumerated nodes as children of that static node. An enumerated node can have enumerated child nodes of its own. When the user expands an enumerated node for the first time, the snap-in that inserted the enumerated node is notified and can insert the child nodes.

Snap-in data that is made available to other snap-ins. To export data, a snap-in must register its extendible [*node types*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*node types*) and document their data formats so that other (extension) snap-ins will be able to interpret the snap-in's exported data. Documentation should include both the interface methods and the format of the data, including [*clipboard formats*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*clipboard formats*) that snap-ins must support to retrieve the data.

They can also add context menu items, toolbar buttons, property pages, and taskpad tasks to extend the functionality of a primary snap-in. Also see [*dynamic extension*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*dynamic extension*) and [*required extension*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*required extension*).
