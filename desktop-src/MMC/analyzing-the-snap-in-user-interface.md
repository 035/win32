# Analyzing the Snap-in User Interface

In [MMC User Interface Elements](mmc-user-interface-elements.md), the graphical user interface (GUI) elements of a Microsoft Management Console snap-in were introduced. This section provides more details of the GUI elements in MMC snap-in development.

The type of detailed information that you need for designing a user interface (UI) depends on the snap-in development environment you choose; however, there are many basic GUI concepts that apply regardless of the development environment. This topic explores these concepts by studying the following GUI elements:

-   [Scope panes](scope-panes.md)
-   [Result panes](result-panes.md)
-   [Context menus](context-menus.md)
-   [Toolbars and menus](toolbars-and-menus.md)
-   [MMC Property sheets](mmc-property-sheets.md)
-   [MMC Wizards](mmc-wizards.md)
-   [MMC Taskpads](mmc-taskpads.md)
