# A Computer Administration Solution

Microsoft has long recognized the increasing complexity and difficulty of computer administration. MMC is a significant part of the solution to these problems. The goal of MMC is to minimize the cost of administering Windows-based computers, and to provide a simple, consistent, and integrated user interface and administration model. One of the strengths of MMC is its ability to support task delegation scenarios. Usability research and customer surveys suggest that there are several distinct types of administration, and that many problems need to be handed off from one administrator to another as the problem is resolved. In the following descriptions, note that one person might perform any or all of these roles, particularly in a small organization employing only a few administrators.

<dl> <dt>

<span id="First-tier_administrator"></span><span id="first-tier_administrator"></span><span id="FIRST-TIER_ADMINISTRATOR"></span>First-tier administrator
</dt> <dd>

Provides Helpdesk support and performs day-to-day administrative tasks such as creating users, restarting workstations (but not servers), and working with end users.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Second-tier_administrator"></span><span id="second-tier_administrator"></span><span id="SECOND-TIER_ADMINISTRATOR"></span>Second-tier administrator
</dt> <dd>

Uses monitoring and troubleshooting tools on a daily basis. Administrators working at this level are often considered to be the experts in solving server problems and usually have in-depth knowledge of an organization's network and server applications. Unusual or complex problems are escalated to this level from the first tier.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Third-tier_administrator"></span><span id="third-tier_administrator"></span><span id="THIRD-TIER_ADMINISTRATOR"></span>Third-tier administrator
</dt> <dd>

Evaluates and rolls out new server applications, designs and defines new operational and support procedures, and develops administration tools as necessary. Critical or cross-application problems may be escalated to this level from the first- or second-tier administrators.

</dd> </dl>

Although system administration is not always so clearly categorized within an organization, there is usually a hierarchy of administrative tasks that are assigned according to the skill and experience level of the administrator.
