# Microsoft Management Console 2.0

## Purpose

The goal of Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is to minimize the cost of administering Windows-based environments, and to provide a simple, consistent, and integrated administration user interface and administration model. It also addresses the varying levels of server administration that are possible.

## Where applicable

The MMC SDK can be used for writing tools, called snap-ins, for administering Windows-based environments.

## Developer audience

MMC snap-ins can be created in any development environment that supports producing COM components.

The MMC SDK documentation shows how to develop snap-ins using C++ or Visual Basic. A familiarity with COM programming fundamentals is required for developing snap-ins in C++.

## Run-time requirements

The MMC Snap-in Designer for Visual Basic is required for developing snap-ins in Visual Basic. The Snap-in Designer is included in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK). MMC 1.2 is available as a redistributable file that can be downloaded from the [Platform SDK Redistributables](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84099) website.
