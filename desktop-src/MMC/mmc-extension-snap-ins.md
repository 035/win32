# Testing the MMC Extension Snap-ins

These tests help ensure that your extension snap-in works with its parent snap-in. Be aware that these tests do not apply to stand-alone snap-ins.

-   Ensure that the user interface of the extension snap-in follows the user interface of the parent snap-in.
-   Ensure that the extension snap-in does not duplicate the functionality of the parent snap-in.
-   Ensure that the extension snap-in does not duplicate menu item names or property page names for any parent snap-ins it extends.
