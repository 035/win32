# Creating Snap-ins

To create a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, a developer must write code and save the file as a dynamic-link library (DLL) using the tools and techniques spelled out in the MMC Software Development Kit (SDK).

Before any coding can begin, a certain amount of planning is required. Much of this planning centers on design issues.
