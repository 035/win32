# Exporting List Views to a File

This feature is introduced in MMC 1.2.

The data displayed in all standard list views can be exported to a text file. When the user clicks the **Export List** context menu item while a scope item with a list view is selected, the visible columns in the list view are exported to a text file in the order in which they appear in the view.

This feature is supported directly by MMC, so there is no development impact for snap-ins.
