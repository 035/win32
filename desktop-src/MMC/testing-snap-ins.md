# Testing Snap-ins

There are many good books available on how to effectively test software to ensure a quality product. This document does not attempt to duplicate the contents of such books. Rather, it calls on the experience of snap-in testers to identify areas that deserve special attention when testing snap-ins. For information for developers about that identifies the areas in snap-in code that should be checked at code review, see [Testing Program Code](testing-program-code.md).
