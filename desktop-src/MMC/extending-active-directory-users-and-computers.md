# Extending Active Directory Users and Computers

This section describes how to extend the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.

For purposes of discussion, assume you are developing a snap-in that extends the context menu and property sheet of Active Directory user objects. To accomplish this, you need to register the node type of any item you wish to extend, and implement the necessary interfaces; for details, see [Registering Node Type](registering-node-type.md).

Note the Steps outlined in [Context Menu and Property Page Extensions](context-menu-and-property-page-extensions.md) provide the high-level instructions necessary for implementing a snap-in that extends the context menu and property sheet. For more detailed information, see [Registering Node Type](registering-node-type.md) and [Accessing an Active Directory User Object](accessing-an-active-directory-user-object.md).
