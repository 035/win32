# Using a Proprietary or Third-Party Installation Package

If you do not want to use Microsoft Windows Installer or the Package and Deployment Wizard, you can use any third-party installation program or your own scripts to create the package and install the snap-in. The process for Visual Basic snap-ins is slightly different from that for snap-ins developed using COM interfaces (coded with C++).
