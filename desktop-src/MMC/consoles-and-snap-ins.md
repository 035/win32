# Consoles and Snap-ins

Remember that MMC by itself provides no management functionality. It acts as a host to snap-ins that provide the functionality for management tasks. This section provides some basic information about MMC and snap-ins so that you can decide whether your functionality belongs in MMC, in Control Panel, or as a stand-alone application.
