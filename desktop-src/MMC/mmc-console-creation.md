# MMC 2.0 Console Creation

MMC has two modes, *author mode* and *user mode*. Author mode permits full control of the MMC environment, including the ability to add or remove snap-ins, create taskpad views, and change many options through the **Customize View** and **Options** dialog boxes. User mode offers three alternative access models that progressively restrict the user's ability to alter the console's contents and appearance.

A system administrator can create a tool that consists of a console with one or more snap-ins and save it (as an .msc file) for future use or for sharing with other administrators. This tool might be used to delegate tasks to others in the organization, to improve workflow, or to coordinate completion of tasks. Separate tools might be created to handle daily, weekly, and monthly administrative tasks. These scenarios illustrate that all the elements necessary to complete a task are together in one easy-to-find place.
