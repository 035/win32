# Dual-Mode Snap-ins

Dual-mode snap-ins must implement the interfaces required by both stand-alone and extension snap-ins; that is, they must implement the [**IComponentData**](/windows/win32/Mmc/nn-mmc-icomponentdata?branch=master) interface for stand-alone behavior and the appropriate interfaces necessary to support the desired extension behavior.
