<span id="mmc_verb_gly"></span><span id="MMC_VERB_GLY"></span>**verb**
</dt> <dd>

Command appearing in the context menu of a scope or result item. The MMC SDK specifies a number of standard verbs, such as cut, copy, and rename, that snap-ins can use as command identifiers in an item's context menu. When the user selects a standard verb in a context menu, MMC sends the snap-in that inserted the command a [*notification*](n-gly.md#mmc-notification-or-notification-message--gly) to allow it to respond to the user action.

<span id="mmc_view_gly"></span><span id="MMC_VIEW_GLY"></span>**view**
</dt> <dd>

[*Multiple-document interface (MDI)*](m-gly.md#mmc-multiple-document-interface-mdi--gly) child window within an MMC [*console*](c-gly.md#mmc-console-gly) that hosts [*snap-ins*](s-gly.md#mmc-snap-in-gly). When MMC is started from a command prompt or the **Run** dialog box, a single, empty view is displayed. Each view has a [*scope pane*](s-gly.md#mmc-scope-pane-gly) and a [*result pane*](r-gly.md#mmc-result-pane-gly).

<span id="mmc_view_extension_gly"></span><span id="MMC_VIEW_EXTENSION_GLY"></span>**view extension**
</dt> <dd>

For MMC 2.0. [*Extension snap-in*](e-gly.md#mmc-extension-snap-in-gly) that extends the functionality of a [*primary snap-in*](p-gly.md#mmc-primary-snap-in-gly) by adding result pane views.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="mmc_virtual_list_view_gly"></span><span id="MMC_VIRTUAL_LIST_VIEW_GLY"></span>**virtual list view**
</dt> <dd>

Also known as owner data. A virtual list view appears to the user as any other [*standard list view*](s-gly.md#mmc-standard-list-view-gly), but the underlying code to populate them is optimized for large data sets.
