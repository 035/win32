Command appearing in the context menu of a scope or result item. The MMC SDK specifies a number of standard verbs, such as cut, copy, and rename, that snap-ins can use as command identifiers in an item's context menu. When the user selects a standard verb in a context menu, MMC sends the snap-in that inserted the command a [*notification*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*notification*) to allow it to respond to the user action.

When MMC is started from a command prompt or the **Run** dialog box, a single, empty view is displayed.
