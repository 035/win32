# MMC Console Files

Developers and end users can save an MMC multiple-document interface (MDI) window—a console populated with one or more snap-ins—as a file with an .msc extension. Anyone in author mode can create such a console file and tailor its look and feel for those that use the tool. You can save the file with any combination of the following settings:

-   **Add/Remove Snap-ins** is disabled.
-   MMC console controls are not displayed.
-   Console tree and scope pane are hidden.
-   A taskpad is the only visible interface.

This ability to build custom tools (saved console files) enables administrators to provide tools that are appropriate to users' skill levels and to control the ways in which users can gain access to and manipulate data. For example, you might create a console file populated with tools to perform specific first-tier administrative tasks. For more information about saved console files, see [Deploying Snap-ins](deploying-snap-ins.md) and [Distributing Your Snap-in](distributing-your-snap-in.md).
