# MMC 2.0 Programmer's Guide

A newer MMC 3.0 SDK is now available as part of Windows SDK. It offers a managed framework for snap-in design and development. The MMC 3.0 SDK is much easier to use and offers several features that allow the developer to focus on the logic of the snap-in rather than the infrastructure.

All later operating systems, including Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, ship with MMC 3.0 pre-installed.

This is a guide for programming with MMC 2.0 SDK. This section covers the following topics:
