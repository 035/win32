# About MMC 2.0

Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is an extensible user interface that provides an environment for running management applications, structured as components, called snap-ins.

MMC snap-ins can be created in any development environment that supports producing COM components. Some of the most common development environments are Microsoft Visual C++ versions 5.0 and 6.0, and Microsoft Visual Basic version 6.0.

This section provides an overview of the MMC elements that affect snap-in developers. The following topics are discussed:

-   [Introducing MMC](introducing-mmc.md)
-   [Creating Snap-ins](creating-snap-ins.md)
-   [Analyzing the Snap-in User Interface](analyzing-the-snap-in-user-interface.md)
-   [Testing Snap-ins](testing-snap-ins.md)
-   [Deploying Snap-ins](deploying-snap-ins.md)
