# Management Information Base

## Purpose

The Management Information Base (MIB) application programming interface (API) provides a set of structures used to contain network and network management data for a number of technologies, including Remote Access Routing Services, Internet Protocol (IP) Helper, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

## Where applicable

The MIB data structures are used to store, manage, and maintain network and network management data from a variety of sources. Such data can include routing information, protocol information, and network statistics.

## Developer audience

Developers using the MIB structures and enumerations should be familiar with basic C programming concepts and Windows networking. The structures provided by MIB can be used across a wide variety of network and network management technologies and applications.

## Run-time requirements

The structures in the MIB API are supported on both Microsoft Windows network servers and clients. For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular structure, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.
