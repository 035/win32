# Generating Reports

You can generate reports that can help administrators to better understand how storage is utilized in the specified directories. A storage report job specifies a set of directories that will be analyzed to generate one or more reports. You can run the report jobs on a schedule or on demand.

The following topics show how to define and run reports:

-   [Defining a Report Job](defining-a-report-job.md)
-   [Adding a Report to a Job](adding-a-report-to-a-job.md)
-   [Running a Report Job](running-a-report-job.md)
-   [Scheduling a Report Job](scheduling-a-report-job.md)
