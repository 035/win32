# Developing FCI Pipeline Modules

You can create extensibility modules that plug into the [File Classification Infrastructure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=178897) pipeline to extend the methods in which files are classified and how their classification properties can be retrieved and persisted.

The following topics show how to work with FCI pipeline modules:

-   [How to develop a custom FCI Classifier in Managed Code](how-to-develop-a-custom-fci-classifier-in-managed-code.md)
-   [Initializing and Binding a Pipeline Module](initializing-and-binding-a-pipeline-module.md)
