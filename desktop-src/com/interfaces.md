An object that has a pointer to the moniker object's [**IMoniker**](imoniker.md) interface can locate, activate, and get access to the identified object without having any other specific information on where the object is actually located in a distributed system.                                                                                                        |

By using this interface, instead of relying on separate calls to [**IUnknown::QueryInterface**](iunknown-queryinterface.md), clients can reduce the number of RPC calls that have to cross thread, process, or machine boundaries and, therefore, the amount of time required to obtain the requested interface pointers.                                                  |

| [**IRunnableObject**](irunnableobject.md)                     | Enables a container to control the running of its embedded objects. In the case of an object implemented with a local server, calling the [**Run**](irunnableobject-run.md) method launches the server's .EXE file. In the case of an object implemented with an in-process server, calling **Run** causes the object .DLL file to transition into the running state.                                                                                                                 |
| [**IRunningObjectTable**](irunningobjecttable.md)             | Manages access to the running object table (ROT), a globally accessible look-up table on each workstation. A workstation's ROT keeps track of those objects that can be identified by a moniker and that are currently running on the workstation. When a client tries to bind a moniker to an object, the moniker checks the ROT to see if the object is already running; this allows the moniker to bind to the current instance instead of loading a new one.                       |
| [**IServerSecurity**](iserversecurity.md)                     | Used by a server to help authenticate the client and to manage impersonation of the client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| [**ISynchronize**](isynchronize.md)                           | Provides asynchronous communication between objects about the occurrence of an event. Objects that implement [**ISynchronize**](isynchronize.md) can receive indications that an event has occurred, and they can respond to queries about the event. In this way, clients can make sure that one request has been processed before they submit a subsequent request that depends on completion of the first one.                                                                     |

| [**IUnknown**](iunknown.md)                                   | Enables clients to get pointers to other interfaces on a given object through the [**QueryInterface**](iunknown-queryinterface.md) method, and manage the existence of the object through the [**AddRef**](iunknown-addref.md) and [**Release**](iunknown-release.md) methods. All other COM interfaces are inherited, directly or indirectly, from [**IUnknown**](iunknown.md). Therefore, the three methods in IUnknown are the first entries in the VTable for every interface. |
