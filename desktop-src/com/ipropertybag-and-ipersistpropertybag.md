# IPropertyBag and IPersistPropertyBag

[**IPropertyBag**](_inet_IPropertyBag_Interface_cpp) and [**IPersistPropertyBag**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa768205) optimize save as text mechanisms, and therefore are recommended for ActiveX Control containers that implement a save as text mechanism. **IPropertyBag** is implemented by a container, and is roughly analogous to [**IStream**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa380034). **IPersistPropertyBag** is implemented by controls, and is roughly analogous to [**IPersistStream**](/windows/win32/ObjIdl/nn-objidl-ipersiststream?branch=master).
