# IPropertyBag and IPersistPropertyBag

[**IPropertyBag**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**IPropertyBag**) and [**IPersistPropertyBag**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa768205) optimize save as text mechanisms, and therefore are recommended for ActiveX Control containers that implement a save as text mechanism. **IPropertyBag** is implemented by a container, and is roughly analogous to [**IStream**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa380034). **IPersistPropertyBag** is implemented by controls, and is roughly analogous to [**IPersistStream**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nn-objidl-ipersiststream).
