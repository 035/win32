# Events in Controls

Although most controls do expose and fire several events, controls are not required to expose or fire any events and thus the control does not require [**IConnectionPointContainer**](/windows/win32/OCIdl/nn-ocidl-iconnectionpointcontainer?branch=master). If the control does have any events, there are no requirements for which events a control must expose.
