# Component Object Model (COM)

## Purpose

COM is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies.

## Where applicable

COM objects can be created with a variety of programming languages. Object-oriented languages, such as C++, provide programming mechanisms that simplify the implementation of COM objects. These objects can be within a single process, in other processes, even on remote computers.

## Run-time requirements

For information on which operating systems are required to use a particular interface or function, see the Requirements section of the documentation for the interface or function.
