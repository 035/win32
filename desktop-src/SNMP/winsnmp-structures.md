# WinSNMP Structures

\[SNMP is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Windows Remote Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa384426), which is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Man.\]

The WinSNMP API functions use the following structures.



| Structure                                  | Description                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**smiCNTR64**](smicntr64-str.md)         | Contains a 64-bit unsigned integer value that represents a counter.                                                    |
| [**smiOCTETS**](smioctets-str.md)         | Contains a pointer to an SNMP octet string of variable length.                                                         |
| [**smiOID**](smioid-str.md)               | Contains a pointer to a variable length array of the subidentifiers that are associated with a specified named object. |
| [**smiVALUE**](smivalue-str.md)           | Represents the value that is associated with a variable name in a variable binding entry.                              |
| [**smiVENDORINFO**](smivendorinfo-str.md) | Contains information about the Microsoft implementation of WinSNMP.                                                    |
