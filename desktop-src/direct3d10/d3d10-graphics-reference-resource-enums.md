# Resource Enumerations

The following enumerations are used to specify information about how resources are created and accessed during rendering.



| Enumeration                                                     | Description                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**D3D10\_BIND\_FLAG**](d3d10-bind-flag.md)                    | Identifies how a resource will be used by the pipeline and determines which pipeline stage(s) a resource can be bound to. |
| [**D3D10\_CPU\_ACCESS\_FLAG**](d3d10-cpu-access-flag.md)       | Specifies the types of CPU access allowed for a resource.                                                                 |
| [**D3D10\_DSV\_DIMENSION**](d3d10-dsv-dimension.md)            | Specifies how to access a resource that is used in a depth-stencil view.                                                  |
| [**D3D10\_MAP**](d3d10-map.md)                                 | Identifies a resource to be mapped for reading and writing by the CPU.                                                    |
| [**D3D10\_MAP\_FLAG**](d3d10-map-flag.md)                      | Specifies how the CPU should respond to any Map methods when the GPU is not yet finished with the resource.               |
| [**D3D10\_RESOURCE\_DIMENSION**](d3d10-resource-dimension.md)  | Identifies the type of resource that is in use.                                                                           |
| [**D3D10\_RESOURCE\_MISC\_FLAG**](d3d10-resource-misc-flag.md) | Identifies less common resource creation options.                                                                         |
| [**D3D10\_RTV\_DIMENSION**](d3d10-rtv-dimension.md)            | Specifies how to access a resource used in a render target view.                                                          |
| [**D3D10\_USAGE**](d3d10-usage.md)                             | Identifies how a resource is expected to be read and written by the CPU and/or the GPU.                                   |
