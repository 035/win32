# Pipes

A *pipe* is a section of shared memory that processes use for communication. The process that creates a pipe is the *pipe server*. A process that connects to a pipe is a *pipe client*. One process writes information to the pipe, then the other process reads the information from the pipe. This overview describes how to create, manage, and use pipes.
