# Adding Members to Groups

A group in an AD LDS instance can contain any number of users, contacts, or other groups as members, just like in Active Directory. Adding members to a group in an AD LDS instance is the same as adding a member to a group in Active Directory. For more information about programmatically adding members to a group, see [Adding Members to Groups in a Domain](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms674995) and [Example Code for Adding a Member to a Group](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms676310)
