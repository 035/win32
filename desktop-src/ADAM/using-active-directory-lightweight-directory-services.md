# Using Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services

This section provides guidelines for writing applications that use or publish data in an Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) directory service.

Writing applications for AD LDS is similar to writing applications for Active Directory. Many of the procedures provided in [Using Active Directory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa746434), [Using Active Directory Service Interfaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa746512), [Using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa367033), and [Using System.DirectoryServices](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=94308) apply to AD LDS. This section presents typical directory service programming tasks designed for AD LDS. The first topic in the section arranges the programming tasks in a sequential order suitable to act as a tutorial for AD LDS programming.

This section includes the following topics:

-   [Quick-Start Tutorial](quick-start-tutorial.md)
-   [Binding to an Instance](binding-to-an-instance.md)
-   [Searching](searching.md)
-   [Creating and Deleting Objects](creating-and-deleting-objects.md)
-   [Extending the Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services Schema](extending-the-active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-schema.md)
-   [Managing Users](managing-users.md)
-   [Managing Groups](managing-groups.md)
-   [Backing Up and Restoring](backing-up-and-restoring.md)
-   [Using Application Directory Partitions](using-application-directory-partitions.md)
