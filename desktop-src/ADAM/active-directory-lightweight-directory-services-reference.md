# Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services Reference

This section contains reference information for programming for Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS).

Generally, programming for AD LDS is similar to programming for Active Directory: all of the programming elements of [Active Directory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa772146) (AD), [Active Directory Service Interfaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa772218) (ADSI), and [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa366961) (LDAP) are supported unless otherwise stated. Programming with the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is not supported.

The following topics discuss the differences between programming elements when used with AD LDS:

-   [Directory Services API Element Differences](directory-services-api-element-differences.md)
-   [ADSI Element Differences](adsi-element-differences.md)
-   [LDAP API Element Differences](ldap-api-element-differences.md)
-   [System.DirectoryServices API Element Differences](system-directoryservices-api-element-differences.md)
