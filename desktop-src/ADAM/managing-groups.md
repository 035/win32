# Managing Groups

Managing AD LDS groups involves creating, deleting, and performing other tasks involving **group** objects, which contain users, contacts, computers, and other groups. Creating and deleting AD LDS groups involves specifying an AD LDS instance, binding to the object that contains the object to create or delete, creating or deleting the object, and setting properties for the created objects.

For more information about managing AD LDS groups, see [Managing Groups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms677279) in Active Directory.
