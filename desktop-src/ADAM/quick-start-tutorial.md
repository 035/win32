# Quick-Start Tutorial

To learn about programming for Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), you can perform, as a tutorial, tasks in the [Using Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services](using-active-directory-lightweight-directory-services.md) section in the order presented in this topic.

To perform this tutorial, install a new instance of AD LDS - without creating an application directory partition. The topics assume that the AD LDS installation is on a local computer and uses TCP port 389 for non-SSL connections. If these assumptions do not apply in your situation, modify the procedures as appropriate. The tutorial consists of the following general steps:

1.  [Creating an Application Directory Partition](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms675765)
2.  [Binding to an Instance](binding-to-an-instance.md)
3.  [Adding User Classes](adding-user-classes.md)
4.  [Adding Contact Classes](adding-contact-classes.md)
5.  [Creating inetOrgPerson Objects](creating-inetorgperson-objects.md)
6.  [Creating Contact Objects](creating-contact-objects.md)
7.  [Creating Organizational Units](creating-organizational-units.md)
8.  [Creating Users](creating-users.md)

12. [Enumerating Users and Groups](enumerating-users-and-groups.md)
13. [Setting User Passwords](setting-user-passwords.md)
14. [Backing Up an Instance](backing-up-an-instance.md)
15. [Restoring an Instance](restoring-an-instance.md)
16. [Removing Members from Groups](removing-members-from-groups.md)
17. [Deleting Users](deleting-users.md)
18. [Deleting Groups](deleting-groups.md)
19. [Deleting Organizational Units](deleting-organizational-units.md)
