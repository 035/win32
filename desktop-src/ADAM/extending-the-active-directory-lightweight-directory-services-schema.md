# Extending the Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services Schema

The base [Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services schema](active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-schema.md) is a limited version of the complete [Active Directory Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8273) documentation.

Most programmers who use AD LDS will extend the AD LDS schema for specific applications. Extending the AD LDS schema is similar to [Extending the Schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms676900) for Active Directory.

This section includes the following topics about extending the AD LDS schema:

-   [Adding User Classes](adding-user-classes.md)
-   [Adding Contact Classes](adding-contact-classes.md)
