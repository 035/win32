# Managing Users with Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services

Managing AD LDS users involves creating, deleting, and performing other tasks involving **user** objects, which represent people and computers. Creating and deleting AD LDS users involves specifying an AD LDS instance, binding to the object that contains the object to create or delete, creating or deleting the object, and setting properties for created objects.

For more information about managing AD LDS users, see [Managing Users](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms677281) in Active Directory.
