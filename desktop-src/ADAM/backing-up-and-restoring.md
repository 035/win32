# Backing Up and Restoring

The process of backing up and restoring AD LDS is considerably more simple than that for Active Directory. It is simple in that it is only necessary to back up and restore only the AD LDS data store and not the AD LDS system state. However, backing up both the data store and system state ensures that the service can be restored easily. The backup and restore can use standard file backup utilities.

This section includes the following topics about backing up and restoring AD LDS:
