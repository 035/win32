# Windows Troubleshooting Platform

## Purpose

Windows Troubleshooting Platform (WTP) provides ISVs, OEMs, and administrators the ability to write troubleshooting packs that are used to discover and resolve issues found on the computer. Previously, troubleshooting software and hardware issues was a manual process; however, using WTP you can automate the process of fixing the most common detectable issues that the user might encounter using your software or hardware.

## Developer audience

ISVs, OEMs, and administrators. Requires familiarity with XML and scripting in Windows PowerShell.

## Run-time requirements

WTP is included beginning with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Requires tools included with the Windows SDK.
