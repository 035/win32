# Building a Troubleshooting Pack

After writing your troubleshooting manifest and scripts, use the following steps to build a troubleshooting pack that WTP can run:

1.  [Create a security catalog](creating-the-security-catalog.md)
2.  [Sign the security catalog](signing-the-security-catalog.md)
3.  [Create a cabinet file](creating-a-cabinet-file.md)

Creating a cabinet file is optional but is useful for deploying your troubleshooting pack.
