# Troubleshooting Tools

The Windows SDK includes the Windows Troubleshooting Pack Designer tool. In addition to helping you author your manifest, the tool also creates a catalog for the troubleshooting pack, signs the pack, and creates a cabinet file that you can use to distribute the pack. The Windows SDK includes the tool in the \\Bin\\TSPDesigner folder.
