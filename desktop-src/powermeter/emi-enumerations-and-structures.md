| Topic                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [**EMI\_MEASUREMENT\_DATA**](emi-measurement-data.md)<br/> | The [**EMI\_MEASUREMENT\_DATA**](emi-measurement-data.md) structure provides data about the current energy measurement and the time at which the measurement was taken.<br/>                                                                                         |
| [**EMI\_MEASUREMENT\_UNIT**](emi-measurement-unit.md)<br/> | The [**EMI\_MEASUREMENT\_UNIT**](emi-measurement-unit.md) enumeration represents the available units of energy measurements that can be retrieved from a device by using [**IOCTL\_EMI\_GET\_MEASUREMENT**](ioctl-emi-get-measurement.md). <br/>                    |
| [**EMI\_METADATA**](emi-metadata.md)<br/>                  | The [**EMI\_METADATA**](emi-metadata.md) structure provides metadata about a device that supports the Energy Metering Interface (EMI) interface, such as the hardware model and hardware revision.<br/>                                                              |
| [**EMI\_METADATA\_SIZE**](emi-metadata-size.md)<br/>       | The [**EMI\_METADATA\_SIZE**](emi-metadata-size.md) structure specifies the size of the Energy Metering Interface (EMI) metadata object that can be obtained from the device by issuing an [**IOCTL\_EMI\_GET\_METADATA**](ioctl-emi-get-metadata.md) request.<br/> |
| [**EMI\_VERSION**](emi-version.md)<br/>                    | The [**EMI\_VERSION**](emi-version.md) structure describes the version of the Energy Metering Interface (EMI) that is supported by a device.<br/>                                                                                                                    |



 

> [!Note]  
> The EMI enumerations and structures are supported in Windows 10 and later versions of the Windows operating systems.
