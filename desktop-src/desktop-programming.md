# Get started with Win32 desktop Windows apps

The Win32 API (also called the Windows API) is the original platform for native C/C++ Windows applications that require direct access to Windows and hardware. It provides a first-class development experience without depending on a managed runtime environment like .NET and WinRT (for UWP apps for Windows 10). This makes the Win32 API the platform of choice for applications that need the highest level of performance and direct access to system hardware.

The Win32 API is just one of several app platforms you can use to build desktop Windows apps. For more info about other app platforms, see [Choose your platform](/windows/apps/choose-your-platform).

## Modernize your desktop apps for Windows 10

Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) offer many features you can use to deliver a modern experience in your desktop apps. Most of these features are available as modular components that you can adopt in your desktop apps at your own pace without having to rewrite your application for a different platform. You can enhance your existing desktop apps by choosing which parts of Windows 10 and UWP to adopt.
