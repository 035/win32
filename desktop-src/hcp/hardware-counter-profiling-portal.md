# Hardware Counter Profiling

## Purpose

Applications use the Hardware Counter Profiling (HCP) SDK to capture thread profiling data such as cycle time and the reasons for context switches. You can also use HCP to capture counter data for hardware performance counters that you have configured on the system.

## Developer audience

HCP is designed for C and C++ developers.

## Run-time requirements

HCP is included in the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems.

For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.
