The Wireless Provisioning Services provide the following COM interfaces:

<span id="IProvisioningDomain"></span><span id="iprovisioningdomain"></span><span id="IPROVISIONINGDOMAIN"></span>[IProvisioningDomain](iprovisioningdomain.md)
</dt> <dd>

Add or query provisioning information from WPS XML files stored on the client.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="IProvisioningProfileWireless"></span><span id="iprovisioningprofilewireless"></span><span id="IPROVISIONINGPROFILEWIRELESS"></span>[**IProvisioningProfileWireless**](iprovisioningprofilewireless.md)
</dt> <dd>

Create profiles from WPS XML data generated by an application or setup program.

</dd> </dl>

> [!Note]  
> **IUnknown** methods are common to all COM interfaces. COM interfaces support the **AddRef**, **QueryInterface**, and **Release** methods. See the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation for more information about **IUnknown** interface methods.
