# Permissions Property Page

The **Permissions** property page contains controls for advanced editing of the [*ACEs*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms721532#-security-access-control-entry-gly) in an object's [*DACL*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms721573#-security-discretionary-access-control-list-gly). This page enables the user to view and edit all of the information in the DACL, including information that is not available on the [basic security property page](basic-security-property-page.md). The advanced information includes [object-specific ACEs](object-specific-aces.md) and information about [ACE inheritance](ace-inheritance.md).

The **Permissions** property page is always included in the [advanced security property sheet](advanced-security-property-sheet.md) displayed when the user clicks the **Advanced** button on the basic security property page.
