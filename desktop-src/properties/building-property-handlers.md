# Implementing Property Handlers

In Windows Vista and later, metadata became central as a method of organizing items such as files, e-mail, or contacts. To enable a system where items can be searched based on their metadata and where users can read or write that metadata, Windows Vista introduced a new property system. Metadata in this system is represented by an extensible set of properties. In this set of topics we describe how you can create a handler that reads and writes properties to and from a file stream. These handlers are called property handlers and each is associated with a given file types, identified by the file name extension.

The following topics discuss the requirements and strategies involved in defining your properties and property handlers.
