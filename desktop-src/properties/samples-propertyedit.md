## Description

This sample shows how to use the [Property System](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Property System) APIs to read and write property values for file types that use the .jpg, .tiff, .doc, .mp3, or .wma extensions, or for file types that have property handlers, such as the [Recipe Property Handler Sample](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Recipe Property Handler Sample).

## Requirements

| Windows                                | Windows Vista           |
| Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) | 6.1                     |



 

For additional requirements, see the Readme file included with the sample.

In the case of the Windows SDK, once you have downloaded and installed it, you will find the samples in the installed directory. For example, use of the default installation path for the Windows 7 SDK results in the samples being placed under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\`.
