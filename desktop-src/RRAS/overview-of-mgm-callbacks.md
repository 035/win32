# Overview of MGM Callbacks

There are two types of callbacks in the MGM API:

-   [Routing Protocol Callbacks](routing-protocol-callbacks.md)
-   [IGMP Enable and Disable Callbacks](igmp-enable-and-disable-callbacks.md)

These callbacks, combined with the MGM APIs, enable the ongoing communication between routing protocols, IGMP, and the multicast group manager.
