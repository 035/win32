# IPX Service Table Management

An IPX routing protocol that registers for service handling maintains a service bindery table as defined by Novell's IPX Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) specifications. The routing protocol also provides the router manager access to this table through the following functions and structures.

-   [Service Table management Functions](service-table-management-functions.md)
-   [Service Table Management Structures](service-table-management-structures.md)

See the [**RegisterProtocol**](/windows/win32/Routprot/nc-routprot-pregister_protocol?branch=master) function for more information on how a routing protocol registers for service handling.
