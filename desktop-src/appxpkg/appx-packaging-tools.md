## App packaging tools and guidance

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio to create and sign an app package. For more info, see [Packaging UWP apps](https://aka.ms/packaging-uwp-apps).

## PowerShell cmdlets

Use Windows PowerShell to install, inventory, and uninstall line-of-business (LOB) Windows Store apps for Windows that are not store-signed. For more info, see: [Appx Module Cmdlets](https://aka.ms/appx-cmdlets).
