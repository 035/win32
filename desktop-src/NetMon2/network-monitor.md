# Network Monitor

## Purpose

Network Monitor captures network traffic for display and analysis. It enables you to perform tasks such as analyzing previously captured data in user-defined methods and extract data from defined protocol parsers.

## Developer audience

All API sets provided by Network Monitor can be accessed using C/C++. Those developers also working with [*network packet providers*](n.md#-netmon-network-packet-provider-gly) must also be familiar with COM.

## Run-time requirements

To call from the Network Monitor API, you must be running on Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows 2000 Server, or Windows Server 2003, or have Microsoft Systems Management Server installed.

The NPP driver and supported features include all versions of Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 Server.

> [!Note]  
> Network Monitor 2.1 and earlier are not supported on Windows Vista and later.
