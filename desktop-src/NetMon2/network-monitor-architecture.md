# Network Monitor Architecture

The Network Monitor architecture can be separated into two sets of programming concepts, those related to [*expert*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*expert*) and [*parser*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*parser*) development and those related to [*monitor*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*monitor*) development.

Although both use the same components to capture the network traffic, they each use different interfaces to capture the data and different components to analyze what was captured.
