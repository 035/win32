Statistics that the network interface card (NIC) reports, and Network Monitor generates. For example, the statistics for the network frames include the number of frames that the NIC reports, the number of frames that the NIC handles, the number of frames that are passed through the capture filter, and the number of frames stored in the buffer or capture file. For a complete list of these statistics, see the **STATISTICS** structure.
