# Network driver reference in SDK header files

This section lists header files and reference for kernel mode Windows network drivers. The header files in this section are included in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) instead of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) as they are also shared with user mode networking applications.

> \[!Important\]
>
> This section's header topics contain pages for network driver reference: structures, enumerations, functions, and callbacks.
>
> For more information about definitions, OIDs, status indications, and other topics that are not part of network driver reference, see [Network driver topics in SDK header files](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/kernel-mode-sdk-topics-for-network-drivers).
