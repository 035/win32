# String Definitions

Strings can be declared using the LPSTR data type, which indicates a zero-terminated string, and with the BSTR data type, which indicates a length-prefixed string (as defined in [Dispatch Interface and API Functions](75BFF268-BD85-49C4-B761-B557F4B1C588)). In 32-bit type libraries, Unicode strings can be defined with the LPWSTR data type.
