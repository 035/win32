# Exposing ActiveX Objects

Exposing objects makes them available for programmatic use by other applications and programming tools. This section discusses how to design an application that exposes objects, and then uses various samples from the COM Programmer's Reference to demonstrate how to implement the design.

> [!Note]  
> Throughout this section, the file names of sample applications appear in parentheses before the sample code.
