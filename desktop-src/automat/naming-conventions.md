# Naming Conventions

Choose names for exposed objects, properties, and methods that can be easily understood by users of the application. The guidelines in this section apply to all of the following exposed items:

-   Objects   implemented as classes in an application.

-   Properties and methods   implemented as members of a class.

-   Named arguments   implemented as named parameters in a member function.

-   Constants and enumerations   implemented as settings for properties and methods.
