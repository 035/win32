# Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)

A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a globally unique identifier (GUID). This number is created by running the Guidgen.exe command line program. Guidgen.exe never produces the same number twice, no matter how many times it is run or how many different machines it runs on. Every entity that needs to be uniquely identified (such as an interface) has a GUID.
