# public

Includes an alias declared with the [typedef](typedef.md)keyword in the type library.

## Allowed on

Alias declared with [typedef](typedef.md).

## Remarks

By default, an alias that is declared with [typedef](typedef.md), and has no other attributes, is treated as a \#define, and is not included in the type library. Using the public attribute ensures that the alias becomes part of the type library.
