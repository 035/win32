# Programmability Interfaces

Embeddable objects, including ActiveX controls, often require access to the programmability interfaces of their containers. Similarly, containers often require access to the programmability interfaces of their embedded objects.

The following sections describe the standards for exposing the programmability interfaces from various components. With the advent of document objects and ActiveX controls on the Internet, adhering to these standards will become increasingly important.
