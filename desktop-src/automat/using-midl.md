# Using MIDL

Files parsed by MIDL are referred to as .IDL files, although they can contain the same syntax elements as .ODL files. The MIDL compiler also compiles scripts written in ODL.

To avoid some common errors that can compromise the security of your system, the following MIDL compiler options are recommended:

-   /robust

-   /error all

For details on these options, see the *MIDL Command Line Reference*.
