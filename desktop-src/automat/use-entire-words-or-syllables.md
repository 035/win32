# Use Entire Words or Syllables

It is easier for users to remember complete words than to remember whether you abbreviated Window as Wind, Wn, or Wnd.

When you need to abbreviate because an identifier would be too long, try to use complete initial syllables. For example, use AltExpEval instead of AlternateExpressionEvaluation.



| Use         | Don't use |
|-------------|-----------|
| Application | App       |
| Window      | Wnd       |
