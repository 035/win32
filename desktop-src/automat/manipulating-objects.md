# Manipulating Objects

After a variable has been created that references an ActiveX object, the object can be manipulated in the same way as any other Visual Basic object. To get and set an object's properties, or to perform an object's methods, use the *object*.*property* or *object*.*method* syntax. Multiple objects, properties, and methods can be included on the same line of code using the following syntax:


```C++
ObjVar.Cell(1,1).FontBold = True
```
