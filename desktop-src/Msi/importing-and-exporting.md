# Importing and Exporting

You can use the installer to import a text archive into an active database as well as to export a database file to a text archive. This can be useful for text-based source control systems.

To import a text archive into an active database, call the [**MsiDatabaseImport**](msidatabaseimport.md) function.

To export a database file to a text archive, call the [**MsiDatabaseExport**](msidatabaseexport.md) function.
