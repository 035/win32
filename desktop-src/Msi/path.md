# Path

The Path data type is a text string containing a valid full path.

The string may also contain a property name enclosed in square brackets \[ \]. In such a case, the name of the property, including the brackets, is replaced in the string by the value of the property.

Examples:

-   UNC path: \\\\server\\share
-   Local drive: c:\\temp
-   With a property name: \[DRIVE\]\\temp
