# Properties

Properties are global variables that Windows Installer uses during an installation. The following sections describe the properties used by the installer:

-   [About Properties](about-properties.md)

-   [Property Reference](property-reference.md)

The term "property" also refers to an attribute of an automation object. See [Automation Interface](automation-interface.md).
