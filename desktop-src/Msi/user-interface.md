# User Interface

Windows Installer provides a complete user interface (UI) for installing an application or product. The user interface presents the user with the options available to configure the installation and obtains information from the user about the pending installation process.

[About the User Interface](about-the-user-interface.md) describes the functionality of the installer user interface. [Using the User Interface](using-the-user-interface.md) describes the use of the installer internal UI.

Reference information on the installer internal dialog box and control styles and options is presented in [User Interface Reference](user-interface-reference.md).
