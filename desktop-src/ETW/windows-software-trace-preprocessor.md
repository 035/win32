The Windows software trace processor (WPP) provides an efficient mechanism to log events that occur during the execution of an application or driver. WPP uses the ETW API.

For details on using WPP to log events, see [WPP Software Tracing](devtest.wpp_software_tracing) and [Software Tracing FAQ](devtest.software_tracing_faq) in the Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK).
