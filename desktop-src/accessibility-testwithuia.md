# Testing with UI Automation and other tools

Testing the accessibility of your Windows applications, assistive technology tools, and UI frameworks is a critical step in ensuring successful user experiences for people with disabilities and other limitations, as well as users who prefer keyboard interactions.

Without adequate access, many users of assistive technology, such as screen reader and on-screen keyboard users, would be unable to use your application. It is important to thoroughly test your application to ensure that it provides adequate information about its UI elements, and that all of your application scenarios can be accomplished with just a keyboard.

This section describes tools for testing the accessibility implementation of your application to ensure that the UI is fully accessible to client applications, people with vision, learning, dexterity/mobility, and language/communication disabilities or limitations, and users who just prefer using the keyboard. It describes tools such as Inspect, AccEvent, and Keros for testing Microsoft UI Automation (UIA) and Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) implementations.
