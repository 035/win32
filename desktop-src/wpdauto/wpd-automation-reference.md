| [**childrenCollection**](childrencollection-object.md) | Object that provides access to a collection of **WPDObject**s.                                                                   |
| [**Creation Container**](creation-container-object.md) | Properties and events for setting properties and data during the creation of a new **Service** or **Storage** object.            |
| [**Device**](device-object.md)                         | Method, properties, and events for accessing device services and storages, and device-specific properties, events, and services. |
| [**Resource**](resource-object.md)                     | Properties and events for working with resources on a **WPDObject**.                                                             |
| [**Service**](service-object.md)                       | Methods, properties, and events for working with a device service.                                                               |
| [**servicesCollection**](servicescollection-object.md) | An object that provides access to a collection of device **Service** objects.                                                    |
| [**Storage**](storage-object.md)                       | Methods, properties, and events for working with a legacy storage on a device.                                                   |
| [**storagesCollection**](storagescollection-object.md) | An object that provides access to a collection of device **Storage** objects.                                                    |
| [**WPDObject**](wpdobject.md)                          | Methods, properties, and events that are common to the **Service** and **Storage** objects.                                      |
