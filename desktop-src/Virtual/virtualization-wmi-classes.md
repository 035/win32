| [CIM Classes](cim-classes.md)<br/>                                             | CIM classes are the base classes that the WMI classes are based on. While not directly used by the Hyper-V WMI provider, they provide much of the infrastructure that the implemented classes use. <br/>                                                                                   |

There is one BIOS element per computer system and that element cannot be replaced or removed.<br/>                                                      |
