# Hyper-V WMI Provider

## Purpose

Hyper-V provides a scalable, reliable, and highly available virtualized server computing environment. It enables one or more guest operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical computer. Key uses for virtual machine technology include the following:

-   Server consolidation
-   Consolidation of development and testing environments
-   Simplified disaster recovery

## Run-time requirements

Hyper-V services require an x64-based system that supports hardware-assisted virtualization running Hyper-V. Programs that interact with the Hyper-V WMI interfaces however, can run remotely on any system that supports WMI.
