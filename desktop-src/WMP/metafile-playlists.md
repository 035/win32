# Metafile Playlists

Windows Media metafile playlists are used to organize stream content and presentation. A playlist can simply redirect Windows Media Player to the content to be streamed, but more commonly will provide a list of files to be played sequentially. A more complex playlist may contain repeats, commercial inserts, and information about the items in the list.

Another advantage of playlists is that instead of playing a stream, stopping, starting the next stream, and then waiting for it to finish buffering, Windows Media Services and Windows Media Player work together to play the clips one after the other with minimal buffering time or interruption.
