# Implementing Other Functions

You will definitely want to write your own implementation of the **Render** function. Several other functions that are also member functions of the **IWMPEffects** interface are provided. Some will provide you with extra information that you can choose to use and others will automatically provide Windows Media Player with information that was generated by the wizard, such as the name of your visualization.

The **IWMPEffects** interface supports the following functions in addition to **Render**:



| Function                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [DisplayPropertyPage](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects-displaypropertypage?branch=master) | Default implementation not supplied by wizard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [GetCapabilities](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects-getcapabilities?branch=master)         | Gets the capabilities of your visualization and passes them to Windows Media Player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [GetCurrentPreset](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects-getcurrentpreset?branch=master)       | The wizard created two presets when it generated the code for your visualization. This function is called when the skin developer wants to get the index of the current preset. You will not want to change the implementation of this function because it just uses information set by other functions. |
| [GetPresetCount](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects-getpresetcount?branch=master)           | The wizard created two presets when it generated the code for your visualization.

The **IWMPEffects2** interface supports the following additional functions:

|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Create](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-create?branch=master)                   | When rendering in a window, Windows Media Player calls this function to allow you to create a new window for rendering.                          |
| [Destroy](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-destroy?branch=master)                 | When rendering in a window, Windows Media Player calls this function to permit you to destroy the window you created when **Create** was called. |
| [NotifyNewMedia](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-notifynewmedia?branch=master)   | This function allows your visualization to respond when a new media item has been loaded by the Player.                                          |
| [OnWindowMessage](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-onwindowmessage?branch=master) | This function receives windows messages from the Player when rendering in windowless mode.                                                       |
| [RenderWindowed](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-renderwindowed?branch=master)   | This function is called by the Player instead of **IWMPEffects::Render** when the Player is rendering in windowed mode.                          |
| [SetCore](/windows/win32/effects/nf-effects-iwmpeffects2-setcore?branch=master)                 | This function receives a pointer to the **IWMPCore** interface.                                                                                  |
