# Interfaces

This section documents the COM interfaces exposed by the Windows Media Player ActiveX control and the Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control.

The accessor methods of the **IWMPCore** or **IWMPPlayer** interface are used to retrieve specific interfaces. These interfaces, in turn, may have accessor methods for retrieving further interfaces. Calling **QueryInterface** on one of these interfaces is only necessary when you retrieve the base version of an interface and want to call a method on a later version of the same interface.

> [!Note]  
> All methods and events are fully supported in Windows Media Player 10 Mobile and later unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Â 

The Windows Media Player control exposes the following interfaces.
