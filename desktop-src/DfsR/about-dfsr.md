</dd> <dt>

[DFSR Overview](dfsr-overview.md)
</dt> <dd>

The Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) service is a multi-master replication engine used to keep folders synchronized on multiple servers. Replicating data to multiple servers increases data availability and gives users in remote sites fast, reliable access to files.

</dd> <dt>

[DFSR Security Model](dfsr-security-model.md)
</dt> <dd>

The Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) service provides two types of security: Active Directory security and WMI security.

</dd> <dt>

[DFSR Replicated Folders](dfsr-replicated-folders.md)
</dt> <dd>

A replicated folder defines a set of files and folders to be kept in sync across multiple servers in a replication group. DFSR uses fence values to ensure that the correct version of a resource is replicated where there is a conflict.

</dd> <dt>

[DFSR WMI Provider Overview](dfsr-wmi-provider-overview.md)
</dt> <dd>

The DFSR WMI provider defines classes for configuring and monitoring the DFSR service. Using these classes, you can create your own tools to perform DFSR service administration tasks.

</dd> <dt>

[DFSR Configuration Modes](configuring-dfsr.md)
</dt> <dd>

The Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) service supports two configuration modes: a WMI-based configuration mode and an Active Directory-based configuration mode.

</dd> <dt>

[Monitoring DFSR](monitoring-dfsr.md)
</dt> <dd>

The DFSR WMI provider provides classes for monitoring DFSR resources and activity.
