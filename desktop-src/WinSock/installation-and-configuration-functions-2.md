# Installation and Configuration Functions

The following functions are implemented in the Ws2\_32.dll, and are intended to be used by applications that install Windows Sockets transport and namespace service providers on a computer. These functions neither affect currently running applications, nor are the changes made by these functions visible to currently running applications.

For all providers, a provider identifier is a GUID which is generated by the developer of the provider (using the Uuidgen.exe utility) and supplied to Ws2\_32.dll.
