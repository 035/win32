# Binding to a Local Address

Before a socket can be used to set up a connection or receive a connection request, it needs to be bound to a local address. This could be done explicitly by calling [**WSPBind**](wspbind-2.md), or implicitly by [**WSPConnect**](wspconnect-2.md) if the socket is unbound when this function is called.
