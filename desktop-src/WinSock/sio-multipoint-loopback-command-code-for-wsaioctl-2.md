# SIO\_MULTIPOINT\_LOOPBACK Command Code for WSAIoctl

When d\_leaf sockets are used in a nonrooted data plane, it is desirable to have traffic that is sent out received back on the same socket. The SIO\_MULTIPOINT\_LOOPBACK command code for [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/win32/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl?branch=master) is used to enable or disable loopback of multipoint traffic.
